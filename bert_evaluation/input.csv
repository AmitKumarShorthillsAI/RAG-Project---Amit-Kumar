What is abstraction in computer science?,The process of generalizing details to focus on what's important.,"According to the context, abstraction in computer science can be described in three ways:

1. **Generalizing concrete details**: abstracting away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance.
2. **Isolating system components**: separating system or network components into layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting others.
3. **Considering less detailed definitions**: observing a program's behavior at a higher level, focusing only on the final result instead of all intermediate steps.

In summary, abstraction in computer science is the process of simplifying complex systems or programs by hiding irrelevant details and focusing on essential aspects.","Abstraction (computer science)
In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is the process of generalizing concrete details, such as attributes, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance. Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering, especially within the object-oriented programming paradigm

Abstraction (computer science)
. It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

Abstraction (computer science)
. When discussing formal semantics of programming languages, formal methods or abstract interpretation, abstraction refers to the act of considering a less detailed, but safe, definition of the observed program behaviors. For instance, one may observe only the final result of program executions instead of considering all the intermediate steps of executions. Abstraction is defined to a concrete (more precise) model of execution"
Which programming paradigm emphasizes abstraction heavily?,Object-oriented programming.,"The answer is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). According to the context, ""Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept"" of abstraction.","Abstraction (computer science)

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering, especially within the object-oriented programming paradigm

Abstraction (computer science)
. Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept. Data abstraction enforces a clear separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type—the interface to the data type—while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time

What is language abstraction used for?,Expressing specific aspects of a system.,"According to the context, language abstraction is used for:

* Generational development of programming languages (from machine language to high-level programming language)
* Stepping stone for moving from one stage to another
* Scripting languages and domain-specific languages
* Providing different types of abstraction depending on the intended applications for the language
* Formally specifying software systems at a more abstract level earlier in a project","Abstraction (computer science)

Abstraction (computer science)
. Different programming languages provide different types of abstraction, depending on the intended applications for the language.

What is the first-generation programming language?,Machine language.,"According to the context, the first-generation programming language (1GL) is machine language, which are simple instructions that can be directly executed by the processor.","Programming language
. The earliest computers were programmed in first-generation programming languages (1GLs), machine language (simple instructions that could be directly executed by the processor). This code was very difficult to debug and was not portable between different computer systems

Programming language
. Often considered the first compiled high-level programming language, Fortran has remained in use into the twenty-first century. Around 1960, the first mainframes—general purpose computers—were developed, although they could only be operated by professionals and the cost was extreme. The data and instructions were input by punch cards, meaning that no input could be added while the program was running. The languages developed at this time therefore are designed for minimal interaction

Programming language
. Among its innovations adopted by later programming languages included greater portability and the first use of context-free, BNF grammar. Simula, the first language to support object-oriented programming (including subtypes, dynamic dispatch, and inheritance), also descends from ALGOL and achieved commercial success. C, another ALGOL descendant, has sustained popula"
What is the second-generation programming language?,Assembly language.,"According to the context, the second-generation programming language (2GL) is an assembly language. It was invented to make programs easier to understand for humans, but it did not increase portability and was favored due to hardware resources being scarce and expensive at the time.","Programming language
. In order to improve the ease of programming, assembly languages (or second-generation programming languages—2GLs) were invented, diverging from the machine language to make programs easier to understand for humans, although they did not increase portability. Initially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while human resources were cheaper. Therefore, cumbersome languages that were time-consuming to use, but were closer to the hardware for higher efficiency were favored

What is Joel Spolsky's criticism of abstractions?,All abstractions are leaky.,"Joel Spolsky's criticism of abstractions is that all abstractions are ""leaky"" - meaning they can never completely hide the details below, but this does not negate their usefulness.","Abstraction (computer science)
. The software engineer and writer Joel Spolsky has criticized these efforts by claiming that all abstractions are leaky – that they can never completely hide the details below; however, this does not negate the usefulness of abstraction. Some abstractions are designed to inter-operate with other abstractions – for example, a programming language may contain a foreign function interface for making calls to the lower-level language

What does a foreign function interface allow?,Calling lower-level languages.,"Based on the context, a foreign function interface (FFI) is not explicitly mentioned. However, if you are referring to the broader context of functional programming and closures, then an FFI might be inferred to allow:

* Functions written in one language to be called from another language, effectively treating functions as first-class citizens across language boundaries.

In other words, a foreign function interface would enable interoperability between different programming languages, enabling functions to be passed around or returned as arguments just like any other data type.","Functional programming
. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner

Closure (computer programming)
. As of the 2011 revision, the C++ language also supports closures, which are a type of function object constructed automatically from a special language construct called lambda-expression. A C++ closure may capture its context either by storing copies of the accessed variables as members of the closure object or by reference

What are specification languages based on?,Abstractions.,"Based on the context, specification languages are not explicitly mentioned as being based on anything. However, it is mentioned that programming language specifications can take several forms, including an implementation of a programming language (conversion of source code into machine code). Therefore, I would infer that specification languages are likely based on the same concepts and principles used to define a programming language, such as logic or standardized sets of symbols and arrangements.","Programming language
. Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea. The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be. A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following: An implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into machine code that can be executed by the hardware

Modeling language
. Model transformation is a common example of such reasoning. Object modeling languages are modeling languages based on a standardized set of symbols and ways of arranging them to model (part of) an object oriented software design or system design. Some organizations use them extensively in combination with a software development methodology to progress from initial specification to an implementation plan and to communicate that plan to an entire team of developers and stakeholders

Formal methods

What is UML used for?,Defining abstract classes.,"According to the context, UML (Unified Modeling Language) is used for both Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA).","Computer programming
. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA. A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling). Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic programming languages. It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular modern programming languages

Domain-specific language
. However, languages like UML are typically general-purpose modeling languages. To summarize, an analogy might be useful: a Very Little Language is like a knife, which can be used in thousands of different ways, from cutting food to cutting down trees.[clarification needed] A domain-specific language is like an electric drill: it is a powerful tool with a wide variety of uses, but a specific context, namely, putting holes in things

Modeling language

What is control abstraction?,Hiding low-level operations in high-level constructs.,"Based on the context provided, control abstraction is not explicitly mentioned as a specific type of abstraction in computer science. However, it can be inferred that control abstraction refers to the process of generalizing concrete details related to the control flow or behavior of a system or program, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance.

In other words, control abstraction involves isolating specific aspects of a program's execution path, such as conditional statements, loops, or function calls, and representing them at a higher level of abstraction, without focusing on the low-level implementation details. This allows for more abstract reasoning about the behavior of the system and facilitates the analysis and modification of its control flow.

It is worth noting that this interpretation is based on the general concept of abstraction in computer science, and it may not be a specific term or definition recognized in the field.","Abstraction (computer science)
. It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

Abstraction (computer science)
. As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer ""I don't know"" to some questions). Abstraction is the core concept of abstract interpretation. Model checking generally takes place on abstract versions of the studied systems

What does structured programming reduce?,Complexity and side effects.,"According to the context, structured programming reduces the complexity potential for side-effects.","Abstraction (computer science)
. Without control abstraction, a programmer would need to specify all the register/binary-level steps each time they simply wanted to add or multiply a couple of numbers and assign the result to a variable. Such duplication of effort has two serious negative consequences: Structured programming involves the splitting of complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow-control and interfaces between components, with a reduction of the complexity potential for side-effects

Software construction
. Reduced complexity is achieved through emphasizing the creation of code that is simple and readable rather than clever. Minimizing complexity is accomplished through making use of standards, and through numerous specific techniques in coding. It is also supported by the construction-focused quality techniques. Anticipating change helps software engineers build extensible software, which means they can enhance a software product without disrupting the underlying structure

Control flow

What does data abstraction separate?,Interface and implementation.,"According to the context, data abstraction separates:

""The abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its implementation.""

In other words, it distinguishes between what is visible to client code (the interface) and how that interface is implemented.","Abstraction (computer science)
. Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept. Data abstraction enforces a clear separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type—the interface to the data type—while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time

Abstraction (computer science)
. In this methodology, data is abstracted by one or several abstractors when conducting a meta-analysis, with errors reduced through dual data abstraction followed by independent checking, known as adjudication. In object-oriented programming theory, abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract ""actors"" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and ""communicate"" with other objects in the system

What is encapsulation?,Hiding internal state details.,"According to the context, Encapsulation refers to the hiding of state details and keeping the internal details of an object hidden from the outside code. It makes it easier to change how an object works on the inside without affecting other parts of the program, such as in code refactoring.","Abstraction (computer science)
. The term encapsulation refers to the hiding of state details, but extending the concept of data type from earlier programming languages to associate behavior most strongly with the data, and standardizing the way that different data types interact, is the beginning of abstraction. When abstraction proceeds into the operations defined, enabling objects of different types to be substituted, it is called polymorphism

Object-oriented programming
. Because data abstraction works well, many programming styles, like object-oriented programming and functional programming, use it as a key principle. Encapsulation is another important idea in programming. It means keeping the internal details of an object hidden from the outside code. This makes it easier to change how an object works on the inside without affecting other parts of the program, such as in code refactoring

Object-oriented programming
. Encapsulation also helps keep related code together (decoupling), making it easier for programmers to understand. In object-oriented programming, objects act as a barrier between their internal workings and external code. Outside code can only interact with an "
What is polymorphism?,Substituting different object types interchangeably.,"Polymorphism refers to the use of one symbol (such as a function) to represent multiple different types. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism specifically refers to subtyping or subtype polymorphism, where a function can work with a specific interface and thus manipulate entities of different classes in a uniform manner.","Object-oriented programming
. Leo Brodie says that information hiding can lead to copying the same code in multiple places (duplicating code), which goes against the don't repeat yourself rule of software development. Polymorphism is the use of one symbol to represent multiple different types. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism more specifically refers to subtyping or subtype polymorphism, where a function can work with a specific interface and thus manipulate entities of different classes in a uniform manner

What is delegation in OOP?,Simplifying relationships within types.,"According to the context, delegation in OOP refers to structuring classes or types inside a program to simplify complex relationships. It is an alternative to inheritance and can be used as a way to control how much of one class is exposed to other parts of the program, similar to the Employee class controlling how much of Person it exposes.","Object-oriented programming
. This lets the Employee class control how much of Person it exposes to other parts of the program. Delegation is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance. Programmers have different opinions on inheritance. Bjarne Stroustrup, author of C++, has stated that it is possible to do OOP without inheritance. Rob Pike has criticized inheritance for creating complicated hierarchies instead of simpler solutions

Abstraction (computer science)
. When it proceeds in the opposite direction, inside the types or classes, structuring them to simplify a complex set of relationships, it is called delegation or inheritance. Various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction, all to support a general strategy of polymorphism in object-oriented programming, which includes the substitution of one data type for another in the same or similar role

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)

What does inheritance allow?,Reusing structure and behavior from other classes.,"According to the context, inheritance allows programmers to:

* Create classes that are built upon existing classes
* Specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface)
* Reuse code
* Independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces","Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed acyclic graph. An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The following table shows which variables and functions get inherited dependent on the visibility given when deriving the class, using the terminology established by C++. Inheritance is used to co-relate two or more classes to each other. Many object-oriented programming languages permit a class or object to replace the implementation of an aspect—typically a behavior—that it has inherited. This process is called overriding

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining sim"
What is the role of templates in C++?,Supporting compile-time abstraction.,"According to the context, the role of templates in C++ is to provide multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime as well as for runtime-flexible arrays. Additionally, templates are used heavily in C++ to implement static bindings at compile-time, which offers flexibility problems.","Array (data structure)
. In C++ (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime as well as for runtime-flexible arrays. Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables. Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records. Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and VLists

Abstraction (computer science)
. C++ exemplifies another extreme: it relies heavily on templates and overloading and other static bindings at compile-time, which in turn has certain flexibility problems. Although these examples offer alternate strategies for achieving the same abstraction, they do not fundamentally alter the need to support abstract nouns in code – all programming relies on an ability to abstract verbs as functions, nouns as data structures, and either as processes

What is object-oriented analysis concerned with?,Real-world relationships.,Object-oriented analysis is concerned with determining the relevant relationships in the real world.,"Abstraction (computer science)
. Decisions regarding what to abstract and what to keep under the control of the coder become the major concern of object-oriented design and domain analysis—actually determining the relevant relationships in the real world is the concern of object-oriented analysis or legacy analysis

Object-oriented programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects can contain data (called fields, attributes or properties) and have actions they can perform (called procedures or methods and implemented in code). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another

Abstraction (computer science)

In general, to determine appropriate abstraction, one must make many small decisions about scope (domain analysis), determine what other systems one must cooperate with (legacy analysis), then perform a detailed object-oriented analysis which is expressed within project time and budget constraints as an object-oriented design"
What is domain analysis?,Determining the scope of abstraction.,"Based on the context, Domain Analysis refers to the process of making decisions about scope (i.e., what aspects to focus on) when determining appropriate abstraction.

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains

Abstraction (computer science)
. Decisions regarding what to abstract and what to keep under the control of the coder become the major concern of object-oriented design and domain analysis—actually determining the relevant relationships in the real world is the concern of object-oriented analysis or legacy analysis"

Software maintenance
. Despite many employers considering maintenance lower-skilled work and the phase of software development most suited to offshoring, it requires close communication with the customer and rapid response, both of which are hampered by these communication difficulties. In software engineering, the term legacy system does not have a fixed meaning, but often refers to older systems which are large, difficult to modify, and also necessary for current business needs"
What is abstract interpretation?,Analyzing simplified models of programs.,"Abstract interpretation is a process that involves deriving information about the behavior of computer programs by considering less detailed, but safe, definitions of program behaviors, which are referred to as abstractions. This process aims to provide an overview of the program's behavior without necessarily considering every single detail or intermediate step of execution.","Abstraction (computer science)
. When discussing formal semantics of programming languages, formal methods or abstract interpretation, abstraction refers to the act of considering a less detailed, but safe, definition of the observed program behaviors. For instance, one may observe only the final result of program executions instead of considering all the intermediate steps of executions. Abstraction is defined to a concrete (more precise) model of execution

Abstraction (computer science)
. As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer ""I don't know"" to some questions). Abstraction is the core concept of abstract interpretation. Model checking generally takes place on abstract versions of the studied systems

Semantics (computer science)
. For example: It is also possible to relate multiple semantics through abstractions via the theory of abstract interpretation."
What does model checking work on?,Abstract models of systems.,"According to the context, model checking works on ""many possible states"", although actual implementations require cleverness and do not simply reduce to brute force.","Automated theorem proving
. Other techniques would include model checking, which, in the simplest case, involves brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force). There are hybrid theorem proving systems that use model checking as an inference rule

Formal methods
. Automated techniques fall into three general categories: Some automated theorem provers require guidance as to which properties are ""interesting"" enough to pursue, while others work without human intervention. Model checkers can quickly get bogged down in checking millions of uninteresting states if not given a sufficiently abstract model

Formal methods
. Critics note that some of those systems are like oracles: they make a pronouncement of truth, yet give no explanation of that truth. There is also the problem of ""verifying the verifier""; if the program that aids in the verification is itself unproven, there may be reason to doubt the soundness of the produced results. Some modern model checking tools produce a ""proof log"" detailing each step in their proof, making it possible to perform, given sui"

Abstraction (computer science)
. It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

Abstraction (computer science)
In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is the process of generalizing concrete details, such as attributes, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance. Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering, especially within the object-oriented programming paradigm"
What does Rice’s Theorem imply about abstraction?,Some program properties are undecidable.,"According to the context, Rice's Theorem states that it is undecidable whether a Turing machine computes a partial function with certain properties. This implies that non-trivial properties of computer programs are essentially undecidable. In the context of abstraction in computer science, this means that Rice's Theorem highlights the importance of abstraction when dealing with computer programs, as it allows us to simplify complex systems and make them more manageable, rather than trying to analyze their behavior directly.","Abstraction (computer science)
. The Cognitive dimensions framework includes the concept of abstraction gradient in a formalism.

Abstractions can prove useful when dealing with computer programs, because non-trivial properties of computer programs are essentially undecidable (see Rice's theorem)

Theory of computation
. Another important step in computability theory was Rice's theorem, which states that for all non-trivial properties of partial functions, it is undecidable whether a Turing machine computes a partial function with that property. Computability theory is closely related to the branch of mathematical logic called recursion theory, which removes the restriction of studying only models of computation which are reducible to the Turing model

What are the database abstraction levels?,"Physical, logical, and view levels.","According to the context, the three database abstraction levels are:

1. **Physical Level**: This is the lowest level of abstraction, which describes how a system actually stores data and includes complex low-level data structures in detail.
2. **Logical Level**: This level describes what data the database stores and what relationships exist among those data.
3. **View Level**: This is the highest level of abstraction, which describes only part of the entire database and exists to simplify user interaction with the system by providing a subset of the data needed.","Abstraction (computer science)
. Since many users of database systems lack in-depth familiarity with computer data-structures, database developers often hide complexity through the following levels: Physical level – The lowest level of abstraction describes how a system actually stores data. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail. Logical level – The next higher level of abstraction describes what data the database stores, and what relationships exist among those data

Abstraction (computer science)
. View level – The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of a database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system. The system may provide many views for the same database

Abstraction (computer science)

What is physical data independence?,Logical structure not affected by physical changes.,"Physical data independence refers to the abstraction provided by the logical level of a database, where implementation details at the physical level do not need to be aware of this complexity. In other words, the user only needs to know about the simple structures at the logical level and does not have to worry about the complex physical level structures that may be used to implement them.","Database
. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS. Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself

Abstraction (computer science)
. The logical level thus describes an entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. This is referred to as physical data independence. Database administrators, who must decide what information to keep in a database, use the logical level of abstraction

Database
. The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is "
What does the view level in databases do?,Simplifies access to needed information.,"According to the context, the view level in databases simplifies interaction with the system by providing multiple views for the same database, allowing users to access only a part of the database without needing to know all the details.","Abstraction (computer science)
. View level – The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database.

The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system. The system may provide many views for the same database

Database
. On the one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model)

What design pattern uses abstraction layering?,Layered architecture.,"According to the context, the answer is:

Layered architecture

This design pattern uses abstraction layering by partitioning the concerns of an application into stacked groups (layers) to isolate system or network components and allow changes in one layer without affecting others.","Abstraction (computer science)
. The ability to provide a design of different levels of abstraction can Systems design and business process design can both use this. Some design processes specifically generate designs that contain various levels of abstraction. Layered architecture partitions the concerns of the application into stacked groups (layers)

Communication protocol
. At the time the Internet was developed, abstraction layering had proven to be a successful design approach for both compiler and operating system design and, given the similarities between programming languages and communication protocols, the originally monolithic networking programs were decomposed into cooperating protocols. This gave rise to the concept of layered protocols which nowadays forms the basis of protocol design

Abstraction (computer science)
. It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others."
Why is layered architecture useful?,Isolates components for easier changes.,"According to the context, layered architecture is useful because it helps keep the hardware architecture simple by allowing complex systems at lower layers to become simple components at higher layers. This makes the system comprehensible to a single mind and easier to evolve as user needs change. Additionally, layering allows for different levels of abstraction, making it useful for design processes that require various levels of abstraction.","Hardware architect
. As user needs evolve, (once the system is fielded and in use), it is a lot easier subsequently to evolve a simple concept than one laden with exceptions, special cases, and much ""fine print."" Layering the hardware architecture is important for keeping it sufficiently simple at each layer so that it remains comprehensible to a single mind. As layers are ascended, whole systems at lower layers become simple components at the higher layers, and may disappear altogether at the highest layers

What critique did Michel Foucault offer about academic disciplines?,"He argued they share control mechanisms with institutions like prisons, classifying and hierarchizing individuals.","According to the context, Michel Foucault offered an influential critique that academic disciplines originate from the same social movements and mechanisms of control that established the modern prison and penal system in eighteenth-century France. He argues that this fact reveals essential aspects they continue to have in common, such as characterizing, classifying, specializing, distributing along a scale, hierarchizing individuals, and potentially disqualifying and invalidating certain individuals.","Academic discipline
. As these specializations developed, modern scientific disciplines in universities also improved their sophistication.

However, it can be inferred that bibliometrics may have limitations due to its simplicity and focus on counting citations. Additionally, the approach may not account for complexities in scientific modeling or algorithm analysis.

A possible limitation of bibliometrics could be:

* Overemphasis on quantity over quality: Bibliometrics may prioritize the number of citations received by a paper or author over their actual impact or validity.
* Lack of context: Simple counting may not capture nuances and contextual factors that affect the flow of ideas, influence, or impact within or among disciplines.

What concept did Turing formalize in computer science?,The concept of algorithm and computation using the Turing machine.,"According to the context, Alan Turing formalized the concept of a ""purely mechanical"" model for computing, which became the Church-Turing thesis.","History of computer science
. This led to work by Gödel and others to define and describe these formal systems, including concepts such as mu-recursive functions and lambda-definable functions. In 1936 Alan Turing and Alonzo Church independently, and also together, introduced the formalization of an algorithm, with limits on what can be computed, and a ""purely mechanical"" model for computing. This became the Church–Turing thesis, a hypothesis about the nature of mechanical calculation devices, such as electronic computers

History of computer science
."" The theoretical Turing Machine, created by Alan Turing, is a hypothetical device theorized in order to study the properties of such hardware. The mathematical foundations of modern computer science began to be laid by Kurt Gödel with his incompleteness theorem (1931). In this theorem, he showed that there were limits to what could be proved and disproved within a formal system

Alan Turing
. Turing died on 7 June 1954, aged 41, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but the evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. Following a campaign in 2009, British prime minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology for ""the appalling way [Turing] was treated"". Queen Elizabeth II granted a pardon in 2013"
When and where was Alan Turing born?,"23 June 1912, Maida Vale, London.","According to the context, Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London.","Alan Turing

Who was Christopher Morcom to Turing?,A close friend and first love who deeply influenced him.,"According to the context, Christopher Collan Morcom (1911-1930) was Turing's ""first love"" and a significant friend whom Turing regarded as ""brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited"".","Alan Turing
. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930), who has been described as Turing's first love

Alan Turing
. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote: I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited.

What is an algorithm?,An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a problem or perform a computation.,"According to the context, an algorithm is:

""A finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.""","Algorithm
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ⓘ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing

Algorithm
. Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols. Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs

Algorithm
. One informal definition is ""a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations"",[need quotation to verify] which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cook-book recipe. In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually—even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable"
"Who is considered the origin of the term ""algorithm""?","The term ""algorithm"" is derived from the Latinized name of Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi.","According to the context, al-Khwarizmi is considered the origin of the term ""algorithm"".

. In the early 12th century, Latin translations of said al-Khwarizmi texts involving the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared, for example Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice, attributed to John of Seville, and Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum, attributed to Adelard of Bath. Hereby, alghoarismi or algorismi is the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name; the text starts with the phrase Dixit Algorismi, or ""Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi"""
How does an algorithm differ from a heuristic?,"An algorithm guarantees a correct result when followed, while a heuristic provides an approximate or practical solution without a guarantee.","According to the context, an algorithm differs from a heuristic in that:

* An algorithm is guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, whereas a heuristic is not.
* An algorithm uses conditionals and can divert code execution through various routes for automated decision-making and automated reasoning. A heuristic, on the other hand, relies on approaches to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.

In summary, an algorithm is a well-defined procedure that always produces the desired output, whereas a heuristic is an approach to solving problems that may not necessarily produce the best or most accurate result, but can still be useful in certain situations.","Algorithm
. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning). In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called ""algorithms"", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly ""correct"" recommendation

Mathematical optimization
. Besides (finitely terminating) algorithms and (convergent) iterative methods, there are heuristics. A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations

Algorithm
. Some common paradigms are: For optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following: One of the simplest algorithms finds the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list"
What is a randomized algorithm?,A randomized algorithm uses random input or random decisions during its process to produce a result.,"A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure, using uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the ""average case"" over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits.","Randomized algorithm
A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. The algorithm typically uses uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the ""average case"" over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits; thus either the running time, or the output (or both) are random variables

Randomized algorithm
. In some cases, probabilistic algorithms are the only practical means of solving a problem. In common practice, randomized algorithms are approximated using a pseudorandom number generator in place of a true source of random bits; such an implementation may deviate from the expected theoretical behavior and mathematical guarantees which may depend on the existence of an ideal true random number generator. As a motivating example, consider the problem of finding an ‘a’ in an array of n elements

What is the significance of the Turing machine?,The Turing machine is a mathematical model that formalized the concept of computation and algorithms.,"The significance of the Turing machine is that it is a theoretical device used as a general model of a computing machine, believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation. It is commonly used in computational complexity theory to analyze and define complexity classes, such as deterministic, probabilistic, non-deterministic, quantum, symmetric, and alternating Turing machines.","Computational complexity theory
. A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem

Computational complexity theory
. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory. Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines

What is pseudocode?,"Pseudocode is a simplified, language-agnostic way to describe an algorithm without using specific syntax.","Pseudocode is a simple and general representation that resembles natural language with code written in a programming language. It can be used to communicate ideas about an algorithm to humans without requiring precision for execution, often interleaving natural language with code written in a programming language.","Algorithm
. Algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines as it focuses on the algorithm's properties, not implementation. Pseudocode is typical for analysis as it is a simple and general representation. Most algorithms are implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is tested using real code

Programming language
. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language

Algorithm
. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be described in plain English as: High-level description: (Quasi-)formal description: Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code:"
What is the purpose of algorithm analysis?,"Algorithm analysis evaluates performance in terms of time, space, and other resources.","The purpose of algorithm analysis is to find the computational complexity of algorithms, which involves determining a function that relates the size of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity).","Analysis of algorithms
. The term ""analysis of algorithms"" was coined by Donald Knuth. Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for efficient algorithms. In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e

Analysis of algorithms
In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms—the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the size of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity)

Analysis of algorithms
. This is an extremely rapid and most likely unmanageable growth rate for consumption of memory resources. Algorithm analysis is important in practice because the accidental or unintentional use of an inefficient algorithm can significantly impact "

Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by German mathematicians Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation. The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation

Big O notation
. In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem. Big O notation is also used in many other fields to provide similar estimates

What is the efficiency of a binary search compared to a linear search?,"Binary search has O(log n) time complexity, while linear search has O(n).","Based on the context, a binary search algorithm has an efficiency of logarithmic growth rate (O(log n)) compared to a linear search algorithm which has a linear growth rate (O(n)). In other words, as the input size increases, the run-time of a binary search program will grow much more slowly than that of a linear search program.","Analysis of algorithms
. Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A, a state-of-the-art machine, using a linear search algorithm, and on Computer B, a much slower machine, using a binary search algorithm. Benchmark testing on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following: Based on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that Computer A is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of Computer B

Analysis of algorithms
. However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error: Computer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a linear growth rate. The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size. Doubling the input size doubles the run-time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth. On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a logarithmic growth rate

This approach is useful because it breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be implemented by software programmers.","Software development
. During the analysis and design phases of software development, structured analysis is often used to break down the customer's requirements into pieces that can be implemented by software programmers. The underlying logic of the program may be represented in data-flow diagrams, data dictionaries, pseudocode, state transition diagrams, and/or entity relationship diagrams

Imperative programming
. Since the 1960s, structured programming and modular programming in general have been promoted as techniques to improve the maintainability and overall quality of imperative programs. The concepts behind object-oriented programming attempt to extend this approach. Procedural programming could be considered a step toward declarative programming

Programming paradigm
. Precise comparisons of competing paradigms' efficacy are frequently made more difficult because of new and differing terminology applied to similar entities and processes together with numerous implementation distinctions across languages.

Why can't time and space complexity be directly compared?,"Because they're different types of resources, and importance depends on the specific use case.","According to the given context, time and space hierarchy theorems induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources.

Interpreter (computing)
. Access to variables is also slower in an interpreter because the mapping of identifiers to storage locations must be done repeatedly at run-time rather than at compile time. There are various compromises between the development speed when using an interpreter and the execution speed when using a compiler. Some systems (such as some Lisps) allow interpreted and compiled code to call each other and to share variables

Programming language
. Some compilers are able to provide further optimization to reduce memory or computation usage when the executable runs, but increasing compilation time. Another implementation method is to run the program with an interpreter, which translates each line of software into machine code just before it executes.

What memory types are considered in space complexity?,"Registers, cache, RAM, virtual memory, secondary storage","According to the context, the following memory types are considered in space complexity:

1. Registers
2. Cache
3. RAM
4. Virtual memory
5. Secondary memory","Algorithmic efficiency
. This section is concerned with use of memory resources (registers, cache, RAM, virtual memory, secondary memory) while the algorithm is being executed. As for time analysis above, analyze the algorithm, typically using space complexity analysis to get an estimate of the run-time memory needed as a function as the size of the input data. The result is normally expressed using Big O notation

Computational complexity
. Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer. Space complexity is generally expressed as the amount of memory required by an algorithm on an input of size n. The resource that is most commonly considered is time

Array (data structure)

What principle explains why algorithms fitting in cache run faster?,The principle of locality,"The principle that explains why algorithms fitting in cache memory run faster is the ""principle of locality"", specifically the combination of spatial and temporal locality.","Algorithmic efficiency
. Nowadays the use of virtual memory appears to provide much more memory, but at the cost of performance. Much higher speed can be obtained if an algorithm and its data fit in cache memory; in this case minimizing space will also help minimize time. This is called the principle of locality, and can be subdivided into locality of reference, spatial locality, and temporal locality

Algorithmic efficiency
. However, the different types of memory and their relative access speeds can be significant: An algorithm whose memory needs will fit in cache memory will be much faster than an algorithm which fits in main memory, which in turn will be very much faster than an algorithm which has to resort to paging. Because of this, cache replacement policies are extremely important to high-performance computing, as are cache-aware programming and data alignment

Algorithmic efficiency
. An algorithm which will not fit completely in cache memory but which exhibits locality of reference may perform reasonably well."
What are the types of locality in computing?,"Locality of reference, spatial locality, and temporal locality","According to the context, there are three types of locality in computing:

1. **Locality of Reference**: Refers to how an algorithm accesses its data.
2. **Spatial Locality**: Refers to how elements in a multidimensional array are stored in consecutive positions in memory for faster scanning.
3. **Temporal Locality**: Not explicitly mentioned, but implied as one of the subdivisions of the principle of locality.

So, the answer is: Locality of Reference and Spatial Locality!","Array (data structure)
. ""Column major order"" is analogous with respect to the first index. In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. This is known as spatial locality, which is a type of locality of reference. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order

Parallel computing
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism"
What does cache-aware programming aim to do?,Optimize memory access to fit and utilize cache efficiently.,"According to the context, cache-aware programming aims to optimize an algorithm's performance by taking into account the relative access speeds of different types of memory, such as cache, main memory, and paging. The goal is to reduce access time and improve overall efficiency by exploiting spatial locality and hardware-cache prefetchers.","Algorithmic efficiency

Hash table
. The linked list of separate chaining implementation may not be cache-conscious due to spatial locality—locality of reference—when the nodes of the linked list are scattered across memory, thus the list traversal during insert and search may entail CPU cache inefficiencies

Hash table
.: 91 In cache-conscious variants of collision resolution through separate chaining, a dynamic array found to be more cache-friendly is used in the place where a linked list or self-balancing binary search trees is usually deployed, since the contiguous allocation pattern of the array could be exploited by hardware-cache prefetchers—such as translation lookaside buffer—resulting in reduced access time and memory consumpti"
How has available memory evolved from early computers to now?,From a few kilobytes to gigabytes—a massive increase in available RAM.,"According to the context, available memory has evolved from:

* A few bytes (early 1940s)
* Kilobytes (early computers)
* Gigabytes (modern computers)

In other words, there was a significant increase in storage capacity from the early days of computing to modern times.","Computer data storage
. Historically, early computers used delay lines, Williams tubes, or rotating magnetic drums as primary storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by magnetic-core memory. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in integrated circuit technology allowed semiconductor memory to become economically competitive. This led to modern random-access memory (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the same time

Algorithmic efficiency
. Modern computers are significantly faster than early computers and have a much larger amount of memory available (gigabytes instead of kilobytes)

Computer memory
. Each word can be accessed by a binary address of N bits, making it possible to store 2N words in the memory. In the early 1940s, memory technology often permitted a capacity of a few bytes. The first electronic programmable digital computer, the ENIAC, using thousands of vacuum tubes, could perform simple calculations involving 20 numbers of ten decimal digits stored in the vacuum tubes. The next significant advance in computer memory came with acoustic delay-line memory, developed by J"

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by German mathematicians Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation. The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation

Big O notation
. Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same asymptotic growth rate may be represented using the same O notation. The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function.

What performance metric is gaining importance due to environmental concerns?,"Power consumption, leading to interest in green computing.","According to the context, the performance metric that is gaining importance due to environmental concerns is **product longevity**, specifically looking at factors such as upgradability and modularity. This suggests that prolonging the equipment's lifetime is a key aspect of green computing.","Green computing
. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers. Many corporate IT departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their IT operations. Yet it is also clear that the environmental footprint of the sector is significant, estimated at 5-9% of the world's total electricity use and more than 2% of all emissions

Green computing
. Green computing can involve complex trade-offs. It can be useful to distinguish between IT for environmental sustainability and the environmental sustainability of IT. Although green IT focuses on the environmental sustainability of IT, in practice these two aspects are often interconnected

Green computing
. In 2011, Fujitsu released a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint. Therefore, the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime. Another report from Gartner recommends to ""Look for product longevity, including upgradability and modularity"

Analysis of algorithms
. The term ""analysis of algorithms"" was coined by Donald Knuth. Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for efficient algorithms.

What are the different types of algorithmic behavior?,"Algorithms may exhibit best, worst, and average case behaviors, depending on the input size and conditions.","Based on the context, the different types of algorithmic behavior mentioned are:

1. Automated decision-making: This involves diverting code execution through various routes using conditionals.
2. Automated reasoning: This refers to deducing valid inferences from algorithms.
3. Heuristics: These are approaches to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.

Note that these types of algorithmic behavior are not mutually exclusive, and an algorithm may exhibit multiple types of behavior depending on its design and application.","Algorithm
. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning). In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called ""algorithms"", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly ""correct"" recommendation

Algorithm
. Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, and control tables are structured expressions of algorithms that avoid common ambiguities of natural language.

What is an efficient algorithm?,An algorithm is considered efficient if its computational resources (time and space) grow slowly as the input size increases.,"According to the context, an efficient algorithm is one where the function's values are small or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. In other words, an efficient algorithm uses computational resources (such as time and space) in a way that scales well with the size of the input, rather than using excessive resources.","Analysis of algorithms
. An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same size may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so best, worst and average case descriptions might all be of practical interest. When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an upper bound, determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm

Algorithmic efficiency
In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process. For maximum efficiency it is desirable to minimize resource usage

Why is asymptotic analysis used in algorithms?,"Asymptotic analysis is used to estimate the performance of an algorithm for very large input sizes, focusing on how the time or space complexity grows as input size increases, independent of the specific implementation.","Asymptotic analysis is used in algorithms because different implementations of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency, and asymptotic estimates are needed to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Additionally, it allows for a focus on the asymptotic performance of an algorithm at the elementary level, which is particularly useful when considering hybrid algorithms that use different approaches based on the size of the input.","Analysis of algorithms
.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Big O notation, Big-omega notation and Big-theta notation are used to this end. For instance, binary search is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the size n of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log n), colloquially ""in logarithmic time"". Usually asymptotic estimates are used because different implementations of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency

Analysis of algorithms
. This is particularly used in hybrid algorithms, like Timsort, which use an asymptotically efficient algorithm (here merge sort, with time complexity n log ⁡ n {\displaystyle n\log n} ), but switch to an asymptotically inefficient algorithm (here insertion sort, with time complexity n 2 {\displaystyle n^{2}} ) for small data, as the simpler algorithm is faster on small data.

What is the role of a model of computation in algorithm analysis?,"A model of computation provides a framework to analyze the efficiency of algorithms based on assumptions about the computational environment, like the time for operations or the abstraction of a Turing machine.","According to the context, the role of a model of computation in algorithm analysis is to specify a computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. This allows for the measurement of the computational complexity of an algorithm given a specific model of computation.","Model of computation
. In the field of runtime analysis of algorithms, it is common to specify a computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. A commonly used example is the random-access machine, which has unit cost for read and write access to all of its memory cells. In this respect, it differs from the above-mentioned Turing machine model.

Model of computation
In computer science, and more specifically in computability theory and computational complexity theory, a model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input. A model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized. The computational complexity of an algorithm can be measured given a model of computation

What is the difference between empirical and theoretical analysis?,"Empirical analysis involves measuring the performance of an algorithm in real-world conditions, whereas theoretical analysis uses models and estimates to predict performance based on the input size, often expressed using Big O notation.","Based on the provided context, the difference between empirical and theoretical analysis can be inferred as follows:

Empirical approach refers to the method of analyzing algorithms or statistical methods by testing them through actual experiments, simulations, or implementations. This approach is limited by its reliance on specific platforms, programming languages, and operating systems.

Theoretical analysis, on the other hand, involves using logical arguments, mathematical proofs, and manipulations of probability distributions to derive results about statistical inference, algorithm performance, or computational complexity. Theoretical computer science, in particular, aims to understand the nature of computation and provide more efficient methodologies through abstract and mathematical concepts.

In summary, empirical analysis focuses on practical implementation and testing, whereas theoretical analysis relies on logical arguments, mathematical proofs, and abstract concepts to derive results about algorithms, statistics, or computation.","Statistics
. Theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference, as well as encompassing mathematical statistics. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments

Analysis of algorithms
. Since algorithms are platform-independent (i.e. a given algorithm can be implemented in an arbitrary programming language on an arbitrary computer running an arbitrary operating system), there are additional significant drawbacks to using an empirical approach to gauge the comparative performance of a given set of algorithms. Take as an example a program that looks up a specific entry in a sorted list of size n

Computer science
. Theoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies"
How does binary search compare to linear search in terms of efficiency?,"Binary search is more efficient than linear search for large input sizes because it exhibits a logarithmic growth rate in execution time (O(log n)), whereas linear search exhibits a linear growth rate (O(n)).","According to the context, binary search has a logarithmic growth rate, whereas linear search has a linear growth rate. This means that as the input size increases, the run-time of binary search grows much more slowly than that of linear search. In fact, for large input sizes, the run-time of binary search will grow much faster than the input size itself (logarithmically), while the run-time of linear search will grow directly proportional to the input size (linearly). Therefore, in terms of efficiency, binary search is generally more efficient than linear search as the input size increases.","Analysis of algorithms
. Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A, a state-of-the-art machine, using a linear search algorithm, and on Computer B, a much slower machine, using a binary search algorithm. Benchmark testing on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following: Based on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that Computer A is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of Computer B

Analysis of algorithms
. However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error: Computer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a linear growth rate. The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size. Doubling the input size doubles the run-time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth. On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a logarithmic growth rate

How do you evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O?,"The time complexity can be evaluated by analyzing the algorithm's behavior, identifying the highest-order term, and expressing it in Big O notation to reflect how the execution time increases with input size.","To evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O, you would identify the dominant term in the expression that represents the time required to run the algorithm.

In this case, the algorithm takes additional steps after sorting, which has a known time complexity of O(n2). The number of additional steps is 55n3 + 2n + 10, but since Big O ignores lower-order terms and focuses on the growth rate as n grows arbitrarily large, we can ignore the constant terms (2n + 10) and focus on the dominant term, which is O(n3).

Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm using Big O notation would be O(n2 + n3), or simply O(n3), since the sorting step dominates the overall running time.","Algorithmic efficiency
. Big O notation is an asymptotic measure of function complexity, where f ( n ) = O ( g ( n ) ) {\textstyle f(n)=O{\bigl (}g(n){\bigr )}} roughly means the time requirement for an algorithm is proportional to g ( n ) {\displaystyle g(n)} , omitting lower-order terms that contribute less than g ( n ) {\displaystyle g(n)} to the growth of the function as n {\textstyle n} grows arbitrarily large

Big O notation
. Its developers are interested in finding a function T(n) that will express how long the algorithm will take to run (in some arbitrary measurement of time) in terms of the number of elements in the input set. The algorithm works by first calling a subroutine to sort the elements in the set and then perform its own operations. The sort has a known time complexity of O(n2), and after the subroutine runs the algorithm must take an additional 55n3 + 2n + 10 steps before it terminates

Algorithmic efficiency

What does a run-time complexity of O(n^2) indicate?,"An algorithm with a run-time complexity of O(n^2) has a time complexity that grows quadratically as the input size increases, meaning the time taken for larger inputs increases rapidly.","A run-time complexity of O(n^2) indicates that there is a constant c_u such that the algorithm's running time will be less than c_u times n^2 as the input size (n) increases. In other words, the running time grows quadratically with the size of the input.","Computational complexity
. For example, the usual algorithm for integer multiplication has a complexity of O ( n 2 ) , {\displaystyle O(n^{2}),} this means that there is a constant c u {\displaystyle c_{u}} such that the multiplication of two integers of at most n digits may be done in a time less than c u n 2 . {\displaystyle c_{u}n^{2}

Analysis of algorithms
. For example, since the run-time of insertion sort grows quadratically as its input size increases, insertion sort can be said to be of order O(n2). Big O notation is a convenient way to express the worst-case scenario for a given algorithm, although it can also be used to express the average-case — for example, the worst-case scenario for quicksort is O(n2), but the average-case run-time is O(n log n)

Analysis of algorithms
. The run-time complexity for the worst-case scenario of a given algorithm can sometimes be evaluated by examining the structure of the algorithm and making some simplifying assumptions. Consider the following pseudocode: A given computer will take a discrete amount of time to execute each of the instructions involved with carrying out this algorithm. Say that the actions carried out in step 1 are cons"
How does the run-time of algorithms affect system performance?,"Inefficient algorithms can slow down system performance, taking too long to execute or using excessive computational resources, rendering the system unresponsive or unable to meet time constraints.","The run-time of an algorithm affects system performance in that it determines how long a program takes to execute, which can vary significantly depending on the algorithm used. A program can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on the algorithm implemented. A slow-growing algorithm may initially seem faster, but as input size increases, it can be surpassed by a faster-growing algorithm, potentially affecting system performance.","Analysis of algorithms
. Run-time analysis is a theoretical classification that estimates and anticipates the increase in running time (or run-time or execution time) of an algorithm as its input size (usually denoted as n) increases. Run-time efficiency is a topic of great interest in computer science: A program can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on which algorithm it implements

Analysis of algorithms
. Quadrupling the input size only increases the run-time by a constant amount (in this example, 50,000 ns). Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it is running an algorithm with a much slower growth rate

Analysis of algorithms
. While software profiling techniques can be used to measure an algorithm's run-time in practice, they cannot provide timing data for all infinitely many possible inputs; the latter can only be achieved by the theoretical methods of run-time analysis. Since algorithms are platform-independent (i.e"
How is empirical run-time data used to estimate the complexity of an algorithm?,"Empirical run-time data can be used to find the constant factors in an algorithm's time complexity by measuring the execution times at different input sizes and comparing them to identify patterns, like linear or quadratic growth.","Empirical run-time data is used to estimate the complexity of an algorithm by taking measurements of run-time (t1, t2) at some problem-size points (n1, n2), and calculating the coefficient a using the formula t2/t1 = (n2/n1)a. This measures the slope of the empirical line on the log–log plot of run-time vs. input size, which is used to estimate the complexity of the algorithm.","Analysis of algorithms

In other words, a lower bound shows that no matter what algorithm is used to solve a problem, its time complexity cannot be less than a certain threshold T(n).","Analysis of algorithms
. A key point which is often overlooked is that published lower bounds for problems are often given for a model of computation that is more restricted than the set of operations that you could use in practice and therefore there are algorithms that are faster than what would naively be thought possible

Computational complexity theory
. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms. To show an upper bound T ( n ) {\displaystyle T(n)} on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T ( n ) {\displaystyle T(n)} .

They are useful because they can improve performance, accuracy, and adaptability by overcoming the limitations of individual AI approaches. In the context of analysis of algorithms, hybrid algorithms like Timsort can take advantage of the strengths of different sorting algorithms (merge sort for large data and insertion sort for small data) to achieve better overall performance.","Analysis of algorithms

What is the time complexity of an algorithm with exponential memory usage?,"An algorithm with exponential memory usage, such as O(2^n), grows very quickly and is often impractical for large data sizes, leading to excessive memory consumption.","Based on the context, we can infer that the time complexity of an algorithm with exponential memory usage would be exponential in terms of the input size. This is because the memory usage grows exponentially as the file size (input) increases.

In other words, if we represent the memory usage as 2^n, where n is the file size, then the time complexity of the algorithm would also grow exponentially with respect to the input size.","Computational complexity theory
. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001 n {\displaystyle 1.0001^{n}} operations is practical until n {\displaystyle n} gets relatively large. Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n 15 {\displaystyle n^{15}} , it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances

Computational complexity theory
. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem. To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} operations before halting

Analysis of algorithms
.} The methodology of run-time analysis can also be utilized for predicting other growth rates, such as consumption of memory space. As an example, consider the following pseudocode which manages and reallocates memory usage by a program based on the size of a file which that program manages: In this instance, as the file size n increases, memory will "

In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key, a collection of which may be a tuple, known as an index tuple. An array is stored such that the position (memory address) of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.

What is a linear array?,A linear array is a one-dimensional array where elements are stored sequentially in memory.,"According to the context, a linear array (also called a one-dimensional array) is the simplest type of data structure, where each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.","Array (data structure)
In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key, a collection of which may be a tuple, known as an index tuple. An array is stored such that the position (memory address) of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called a one-dimensional array

Array (data structure)
. The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array. In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a ""linear"" formula on the indices. A one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array

Array (data structure)
. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use. The term ""array"" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data"
What is the base address of an array?,The base address is the memory address of the first element in an array.,"According to the context, the base address B is a fixed value that represents the starting address of the array. If the valid indices start at 0, then B is simply the address of the first element of the array. In general, the base address can be any arbitrary value chosen by the programmer or system, as long as it is used consistently to calculate the addresses of all elements in the array.","Array (data structure)
. However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address B. For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address B is replaced by B + 30c, then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35. If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant B may not be the address of any element

Array (data structure)
. For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c · i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride. If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element ""zeroth"" rather than ""first""

Array (data structure)
. For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i "
How are multidimensional arrays stored in memory?,"Multidimensional arrays are stored either in row-major or column-major order, depending on the programming language.","Based on the context, it is not explicitly stated how multidimensional arrays are stored in memory. However, it can be inferred that a multidimensional array would be stored as a linear array with each element of the inner arrays being adjacent to each other in memory.

For example, if you have a 2D array with two rows and three columns, it could be stored as:

element[0][0] at address X
element[0][1] at address X+4
element[0][2] at address X+8
element[1][0] at address X+12
element[1][1] at address X+16
element[1][2] at address X+20

This is known as column-major order.","Array (data structure)
. ""Column major order"" is analogous with respect to the first index. In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. This is known as spatial locality, which is a type of locality of reference. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order

. For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that t"
What is the difference between row-major and column-major order?,"In row-major order, elements in each row are stored in consecutive memory positions, while in column-major order, elements in each column are stored consecutively.","According to the context, the difference between row-major and column-major order is:

* In row-major order, the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row.
* In column-major order, the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column.

In other words, row-major order stores rows contiguously in memory, while column-major order stores columns contiguously.","Array (data structure)
. For example, consider the matrix In the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row: In column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column: For arrays

Array (data structure)
. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array. For example, when computing the product A·B of two matrices, it would be best to have A stored in row-major order, and B in column-major order. Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed

What is the significance of array indexing starting from 0 in many programming languages?,"Zero-based indexing simplifies the implementation, where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of the array.","According to the context, the significance of array indexing starting from 0 in many programming languages (such as C, Java, and Lisp) is that it leads to a simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array.","Matrix (mathematics)
. Some programming languages start the numbering of array indexes at zero, in which case the entries of an m-by-n matrix are indexed by 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq i\leq m-1} and 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq j\leq n-1} . This article follows the more common convention in mathematical writing where enumeration starts from 1. The set of all m-by-n real matrices is often denoted M ( m , n ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}(m,n),} or M m × n ( R )

Array (data structure)
. An index maps the array value to a stored object. There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed: Using zero based indexing is the design choice of many influential programming languages, including C, Java and Lisp. This leads to simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero

Array (data structure)
. For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c · i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride. If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simp"
What is a dynamic array?,"A dynamic array is an array that allows elements to be inserted or removed, with size that can grow or shrink.","According to the context, a dynamic array can be effectively implemented by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it. This allows for dynamic memory allocation, where elements can be added or removed from the end of the array without having to reallocate the entire array.","Array (data structure)
. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a dynamic version of an array; see dynamic array. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time. Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size

Array (data structure)
. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate ""dynamic memory"" portably. Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple IF statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose-built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array

Array (data structure)
In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key, a collection of which may be a tuple, known as an index tuple. An array is store"
What is a dope vector in relation to arrays?,"A dope vector is a record that contains information about an array's dimensions, base address, and element size, facilitating array operations.","A dope vector is a record that packs the parameters needed to fully define an array's addressing formula, including the dimension d, base address B, and increments c1, c2, ..., ck. It also typically includes information such as the size of each element and minimum/maximum values allowed for each index. The dope vector serves as a complete handle for the array, making it convenient to pass arrays as arguments to procedures.","Array (data structure)
. The addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension d, the base address B, and the increments c1, c2, ..., ck. It is often useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array's descriptor, stride vector, or dope vector. The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector. The dope vector is a complete handle for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to procedures

Array (data structure)
. Many useful array slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector. Often the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory. However, that is not necessary. Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them

Array (data structure)
. Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called ""matrices"". In some cases the term ""vector"
What is the concept of spatial locality in arrays?,"Spatial locality refers to the property that elements stored consecutively in memory allow faster scanning, enhancing iteration performance.","According to the context, spatial locality refers to the fact that scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory. This means that accessing elements in a contiguous block of memory (i.e., a ""hot zone"" in the cache) is more efficient than accessing scattered or non-contiguous elements.","Array (data structure)
. ""Column major order"" is analogous with respect to the first index. In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. This is known as spatial locality, which is a type of locality of reference. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order

Array (data structure)
. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does not mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time)

Algorithmic efficiency
. Nowadays the use of virtual memory appears to provide much more memory, but at the cost of performance. Much higher speed can be obtained if an algorithm and its data fit in cache memory; in this case minimizing space will also help minimize time. This is called the principle of locality, and can be subdivided into locality of reference, spatial locality, and temp"
How does a dynamic array differ from a static array?,"A dynamic array allows resizing, while a static array has a fixed size once created.","According to the context, a dynamic array differs from a static array in that it has the ability to insert and delete elements, whereas a static array does not. Additionally, dynamic arrays reserve linear (Θ(n)) additional storage, whereas static arrays do not reserve any additional storage. Static arrays have a fixed maximum size or capacity, while dynamic arrays can be resized as needed.","Array (data structure)
. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form. Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism. Dynamic arrays or growable arrays are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear (Θ(n)) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage

Array (data structure)
. This effectively makes the array a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size or capacity; Pascal strings are examples of this. More complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional triangular array, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2. Both store and select take (deterministic worst case) constant time. Arrays take linear (O(n)) space in the number of elements n that they hold

What is an associative array?,An associative array is a data structure that allows array-like functionality without significant storage overhead for sparse index values.,"An associative array is an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, where each possible key appears at most once in the collection.","Associative array
In computer science, an associative array, key-value store, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. In mathematical terms, an associative array is a function with finite domain. It supports 'lookup', 'remove', and 'insert' operations. The dictionary problem is the classic problem of designing efficient data structures that implement associative arrays

Associative array
. In an associative array, the association between a key and a value is often known as a ""mapping""; the same word may also be used to refer to the process of creating a new association. The operations that are usually defined for an associative array are: Associative arrays may also include other operations such as determining the number of mappings or constructing an iterator to loop over all the mappings

Array (data structure)
. Associative arrays provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a s"
How are elements accessed in a two-dimensional array using zero-based indexing?,"In a zero-based indexed two-dimensional array, elements are accessed using two indices, such as ar[i][j] where i is the row and j is the column.","According to the context, elements in a two-dimensional array are accessed using multiple indices. For example, in a two-dimensional array A with three rows and four columns, you can access the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by using the expression `A[1][3]`, assuming zero-based indexing.","Array (data structure)
. Arrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example, a two-dimensional array A with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression A in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and n for an n-dimensional array

Array (data structure)
. An index maps the array value to a stored object. There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed: Using zero based indexing is the design choice of many influential programming languages, including C, Java and Lisp. This leads to simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero

Array (data structure)

What is an Iliffe vector in the context of multidimensional arrays?,"An Iliffe vector is a one-dimensional array of pointers to arrays, used to represent jagged arrays with rows of different sizes.","According to the provided context, an Iliffe vector is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure.","Array (data structure)
. Balanced trees require O(log n) time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log n) time, whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ(n)) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position. Linked lists allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear. An Iliffe vector is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure

Array (data structure)
. For a multidimensional array, the element with indices i,j would have address B + c · i + d · j, where the coefficients c and d are the row and column address increments, respectively. More generally, in a k-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices i1, i2, ..., ik is For example: int a; This means that array a has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the array is of integer type

What are the challenges of knowledge representation in AI?,"Challenges include the vastness of commonsense knowledge and the difficulty in representing sub-symbolic knowledge, which humans intuitively understand.","Based on the context, the challenges of knowledge representation in AI include:

1. The breadth of commonsense knowledge: The enormous amount of atomic facts that the average person knows.
2. The sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as ""facts"" or ""statements"" that they could express verbally.
3. Knowledge acquisition: Obtaining knowledge for AI applications.

These challenges make it difficult to develop accurate and efficient reasoning in AI, which is necessary for tasks such as answering questions intelligently, making deductions about real-world facts, and supporting artificial general intelligence (AGI).","Artificial intelligence

How does reinforcement learning work?,"In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.","According to the provided context, reinforcement learning works by having an agent receive a current state and reward at each time step, then choosing an action from the set of available actions. The environment responds by moving to a new state and determining the reward associated with the transition. The goal is for the agent to learn an optimal or near-optimal policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal over time.","Reinforcement learning
. Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision process: The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal (or near-optimal) policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from immediate rewards. This is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology

Reinforcement learning
. At each time step t, the agent receives the current state S t {\displaystyle S_{t}} and reward R t {\displaystyle R_{t}} . It then chooses an action A t {\displaystyle A_{t}} from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state S t + 1 {\displaystyle S_{t+1}} and the reward R t + 1 {\displaystyle R_{t+1}} associated with the transition ( S t , A t , S t + 1 ) {\displaystyle (S_{t},A_{t},S_{t+1})} is determined

Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks, through the backpropagation algorithm

Reinforcement learning

How does adversarial search apply to games?,"Adversarial search is used in games like chess, where the AI explores possible moves and countermoves to find a winning position.","According to the context, Adversarial search applies to game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.","Artificial intelligence
. Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. ""Heuristics"" or ""rules of thumb"" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position

Reinforcement learning
. This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space. The work on learning ATARI games by Google DeepMind increased attention to deep reinforcement learning or end-to-end reinforcement learning. Adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies

Game theory

Multi-task learning
. This view provide insight about how to build efficient algorithms based on gradient descent optimization (GD), which is particularly important for training deep neural networks. In GD for MTL, the problem is that each task provides its own loss, and it is not clear how to combine all losses and create a single unified gradient, leading to several different aggregation strategies

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated

Evolutionary computation

. Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as ""and"", ""or"", ""not"" and ""implies"") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as ""Every X is a Y"" and ""There are some Xs that are Ys"")

A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases

All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience

Artificial intelligence
. Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).

The problems of interest in RL have also been studied in the theory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation (particularly in the absence of a mathematica"
What does a class define in object-oriented programming?,"A class defines the shared aspects of objects, including state (variables) and behavior (methods).","According to the context, a class defines the shared aspects of objects created from the class. This includes:

1. State (variables) that can differ between each instance of the class.
2. Behavior (methods) that are either associated with a particular object or with all objects of that class.

In other words, a class defines the characteristics and capabilities of an object, including its data format (variables) and actions it can take (methods).","Class (computer programming)
In object-oriented programming, a class defines the shared aspects of objects created from the class. The capabilities of a class differ between programming languages, but generally the shared aspects consist of state (variables) and behavior (methods) that are each either associated with a particular object or with all objects of that class. Object state can differ between each instance of the class whereas the class state is shared by all of them

Object-oriented programming
. This inheritance can use either ""classes"" or ""prototypes"", which have some differences but use similar terms for ideas like ""object"" and ""instance"". In class-based programming, the most common type of OOP, every object is an instance of a specific class. The class defines the data format, like variables (e.g., name, age) and methods (actions the object can take). Every instance of the class has the same set of variables and methods

Object state can differ between each instance of the class whereas the class state is shared by all of them

Class (computer programming)
. The object methods include access to the object state (via an implicit or explicit parameter that references the object) whereas class methods do not. If the language supports inheritance, a class can be defined based on another class with all of its state and behavior plus additional state and behavior that further specializes the class. The specialized class is a sub-class, and the class it is based on is its superclass

What does a class method do?,"A class method operates on the class itself, while an object method operates on an instance of the class.","According to the context, a class defines an implementation of an interface, and instantiating the class results in an object that exposes the implementation via the interface. It can be inferred that a class method (or member function) provides the implementation for the methods defined in the interface. In other words, it is the code that implements the behavior specified by the interface.","Class (computer programming)
. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another. As a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile time construct

Class (computer programming)
. An object expresses data type as an interface – the type of each member variable and the signature of each member function (method). A class defines an implementation of an interface, and instantiating the class results in an object that exposes the implementation via the interface. In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation‍—‌a concrete data structure and collection of subroutines‍—‌while a type is an interface

Class (computer programming)
. Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods—such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators—are created and called by compiler-generated code.

What is the purpose of inheritance in object-oriented programming?,"Inheritance allows a class to be based on another, inheriting its state and behavior with additional features.","According to the context, the purposes of inheritance in object-oriented programming are:

* To create classes that are built upon existing classes
* To specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface)
* To reuse code
* To independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces.","Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed acyclic graph. An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The following table shows which variables and functions get inherited dependent on the visibility given when deriving the class, using the terminology established by C++. Inheritance is used to co-relate two or more classes to each other. Many object-oriented programming languages permit a class or object to replace the implementation of an aspect—typically a behavior—that it has inherited. This process is called overriding

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining sim"
What is instantiation in the context of object-oriented programming?,"Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class, allocating memory, and initializing its state.","In the context of object-oriented programming, instantiation refers to the process of creating a new object from a class. This involves allocating memory for the object's state and providing a reference to the consuming code. In other words, it is the creation of an instance of a class, which results in a unique object with its own set of attributes (data) and methods (actions).","Object-oriented programming
. Some classes are abstract, meaning they cannot be directly instantiated into objects; they're only meant to be inherited into other classes. Other classes are utility classes which contain only class variables and methods and are not meant to be instantiated or subclassed. In prototype-based programming, there aren't any classes. Instead, each object is linked to another object, called its prototype or parent

Class (computer programming)
. As an instance of a class, an object is constructed from a class via instantiation. Memory is allocated and initialized for the object state and a reference to the object is provided to consuming code. The object is usable until it is destroyed – its state memory is de-allocated. Most languages allow for custom logic at lifecycle events via a constructor and a destructor

Object-oriented programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects can contain data (called fields, attributes or properties) and have actions they can perform (called procedures or methods and implemented in code). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects tha"
What is the difference between an abstract class and a concrete class?,"An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly, while a concrete class can be instantiated.","According to the context, an abstract class is a class that cannot be directly instantiated, whereas a concrete class is a class that can be directly instantiated. An abstract class can only be instantiated indirectly via a concrete subclass, while a concrete class can be created directly.","Class (computer programming)
. In a language that supports inheritance, an abstract class, or abstract base class (ABC), is a class that cannot be directly instantiated. By contrast, a concrete class is a class that can be directly instantiated. Instantiation of an abstract class can occur only indirectly, via a concrete subclass. An abstract class is either labeled as such explicitly or it may simply specify abstract methods (or virtual methods)

Class (computer programming)
. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system). For example, the type (interface) Stack might be implemented by SmallStack that is fast for small stacks but scales poorly and ScalableStack that scales well but has high overhead for small stacks. A class contains data field descriptions (or properties, fields, data members, or attributes)

Class (computer programming)
. Most object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated. For example, in Java, C# and PHP, the keyword abstract is used. In C++, an abstract class is a class having at least one abstract "
What is the role of an interface in object-oriented programming?,An interface defines the methods and attributes that a class must implement without specifying the implementation.,"According to the context, the interface of a class in object-oriented programming refers to the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit getter and setter methods). In other words, the interface represents the publicly accessible features of a class that can be used by external code.","Class (computer programming)
. In languages that support access specifiers, the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit getter and setter methods); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external code and thus are not part of the interface. Object-oriented programming methodology dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other

Object-oriented programming
. Encapsulation also helps keep related code together (decoupling), making it easier for programmers to understand. In object-oriented programming, objects act as a barrier between their internal workings and external code. Outside code can only interact with an object by calling specific public methods or variables. If a class only allows access to its data through methods and not directly, this is called information hiding

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The superclass establishes a common interface and foundational functionality, which specialized subclasses can inherit, modify, and supplement. The software inherited by a subclass is"
What is the significance of access specifiers in a class?,"Access specifiers control the visibility and accessibility of a class's members, such as methods and attributes.","According to the context, the significance of access specifiers in a class is to:

* Enforce class invariants (constraints on the state of objects)
* Separate internal data from the interface: make private the internal structure and use public accessor methods to inspect or alter it
* Define the interface of a class, which includes public members (methods and attributes), and not intend for external code to depend on private members or internal data structures.","Class (computer programming)
. Object-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants—constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public accessor methods can be used to inspect or alter such private data

Class (computer programming)
. Access specifiers do not necessarily control visibility, in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at runtime (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from the client code will be prevented by the type checker

In languages that support access specifiers, the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit getter and setter methods); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external"
What is composition in object-oriented programming?,"Composition is when a class is composed of other classes, establishing a ""has-a"" relationship between them.","Composition in object-oriented programming refers to a situation where one object contains another object (or objects of one class contain objects of another class). This type of structure shows ""has-a"" relationships, such as ""an employee has an address"". For example, an Employee object might have an Address object inside it, along with other information like ""first_name"" and ""position"".","Object-oriented programming
. Objects are usually stored in memory, and in many programming languages, they work like pointers that link directly to a contiguous block containing the object instances's data. Objects can contain other objects. This is called object composition. For example, an Employee object might have an Address object inside it, along with other information like ""first_name"" and ""position"". This type of structures shows ""has-a"" relationships, like ""an employee has an address""

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. Inheritance is contrasted with object composition, where one object contains another object (or objects of one class contain objects of another class); see composition over inheritance. In contrast to subtyping’s is-a relationship, composition implements a has-a relationship. Mathematically speaking, inheritance in any system of classes induces a strict partial order on the set of classes in that system

Object-oriented programming

What is multiple inheritance and how is it handled in modern languages?,"Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one class, but many languages (e.g., Java) only allow single inheritance.","Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from more than one superclass or parent class. In modern languages, such as Smalltalk and Java, this feature can be useful for modeling but not necessarily for implementation at runtime. Some languages, like Python, also support multiple inheritance.","Class (computer programming)
. If used carelessly this feature can introduce some of the same system complexity and ambiguity classes were designed to avoid. Most modern object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk and Java require single inheritance at run time. For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation. However, semantic web application objects do have multiple superclasses

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The idea then spread to Smalltalk, C++, Java, Python, and many other languages. There are various types of inheritance, based on paradigm and specific language. ""Multiple inheritance ... was widely supposed to be very difficult to implement efficiently. For example, in a summary of C++ in his book on Objective C, Brad Cox actually claimed that adding multiple inheritance to C++ was impossible. Thus, multiple inheritance seemed more of a challenge

What is a sealed class?,"A sealed class cannot be subclassed, ensuring that it cannot be extended or modified.","A sealed class is a class that cannot be subclassed. It is implicitly concrete, meaning it can be instantiated and used directly, unlike abstract classes which must be derived to be used. In other words, a sealed class cannot be inherited from or extended by another class.","Class (computer programming)
. A sealed class is implicitly concrete. A class declared as sealed via the keyword sealed in C# or final in Java or PHP. For example, Java's String class is marked as final. Sealed classes may allow a compiler to perform optimizations that are not available for classes that can be subclassed. An open class can be changed. Typically, an executable program cannot be changed by customers. Developers can often change some classes, but typically cannot change standard or built-in ones

Class (computer programming)
. In some languages, such as Python, Ruby or Smalltalk, a class is also an object; thus each class is an instance of a unique metaclass that is built into the language. The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) provides metaobject protocols (MOPs) to implement those classes and metaclasses. A sealed class cannot be subclassed. It is basically the opposite of an abstract class, which must be derived to be used. A sealed class is implicitly concrete

What is a metaclass?,"A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes themselves, used to describe the structure of other classes.","According to the context, a metaclass is a class where instances are classes. It describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a design pattern or describe particular kinds of classes.","Class (computer programming)
. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables. A metaclass is a class where instances are classes. A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a design pattern or describe particular kinds of classes.

. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationship among electrical activity of the neurons in the ensemble. It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information, and that neurons follow the principles of information theory and compress information, and detect and correct errors in the signals that are sent throughout the brain and wider nervous system.

Coding theory
Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their respective fitness for specific applications. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, data transmission and data storage.

4. Coding theory that helps synchronization","Coding theory
. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data. There are four types of coding: Data compression attempts to remove unwanted redundancy from the data from a source in order to transmit it more efficiently.

In a systematic scheme, the transmitter sends the original (error-free) data and attaches a fixed number of check bits (or parity data), which are derived from the data bits by some encoding algorithm. If error detection is required, a receiver can simply apply the same algorithm to the received data bits and compare its output with the received check bits; if the values do not match, an error has occurred at some point during the transmission

. A closed-loop controller uses feedback to control states or outputs of a dynamical system. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., voltage applied to an electric motor) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with sensors and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is ""fed back"" as input to the process, closing the loop

Fundamentally, there are two types of control loop: open-loop control (feedforward), and closed-loop control (feedback)

Control theory
Control theory is a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or "
How does modern control theory differ from classical?,"It uses state-space models and handles MIMO systems, unlike classical theory.","According to the context, modern control theory differs from classical control theory in that:

* Classical control theory uses frequency-domain analysis, whereas modern control theory uses time-domain state space representation.
* This means that modern control theory utilizes a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output, and state variables related by first-order differential equations.

In summary, modern control theory differs from classical control theory in its analytical approach, using time-domain state space representations instead of frequency-domain analysis.","Control theory
. The field of control theory can be divided into two branches: Mathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories: In contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain state space representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations

Control theory
. Many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain. A controller designed using classical theory often requires on-site tuning due to incorrect design approximations. Yet, due to the easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory, these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications

What is Lyapunov stability?,A system's tendency to return to equilibrium without oscillations.,"According to the context, Lyapunov stability refers to a set of criteria used to describe the stability of a general dynamical system with no input. In other words, it is a method for determining whether a system will remain stable and not diverge over time. Specifically, Lyapunov stability criteria are used to determine the stability of a system without considering its internal dynamics.","Control theory
. Being fairly new, modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored. Scholars like Rudolf E. Kálmán and Aleksandr Lyapunov are well known among the people who have shaped modern control theory. The stability of a general dynamical system with no input can be described with Lyapunov stability criteria. For simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems

Control theory
. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks. Every control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For linear systems, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Nonlinear control systems use specific theories (normally based on Aleksandr Lyapunov's Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system

Control theory
. These, e.g., feedback linearization, backstepping, sliding mode control, trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on Lyapunov's theory.

What condition must transfer function poles meet for stability?,All poles must have negative real parts (continuous-time case).,"According to the context, for a causal linear system to be stable, all of the poles of its transfer function must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.","Control theory
. Mathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the poles of its transfer function must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero. Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside The difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions

Control theory
. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.

. The Space Race also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics and artificial intelligence. Here, one might say that the goal is to find an internal model that obeys the good regulator theorem. So, for example, in economics, the more accurately a (stock or commodities) trading model represents the actions of the market, the more easily it can control that market (and extract ""useful work"" (profits) from it)

Industrial process control

Once margins are narrowed, an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted. Less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency. Effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them.

. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have R e [ λ ] < − λ ¯ {\displaystyle Re[\lambda ]<-{\overline {\lambda }}} , where λ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\lambda }}} is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that R e [ λ ] < 0 {\displaystyle Re[\lambda ]<0}

Control theory
. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed.

What is the state-value function in reinforcement learning?,It represents the expected cumulative reward for an agent starting from a given state and following a specific policy.,"The state-value function in reinforcement learning is defined as Vπ(s), which represents the expected discounted return starting with state s and successively following policy π.","Reinforcement learning
. The state-value function V π ( s ) {\displaystyle V_{\pi }(s)} is defined as, expected discounted return starting with state s {\displaystyle s} , i.e. S 0 = s {\displaystyle S_{0}=s} , and successively following policy π {\displaystyle \pi } . Hence, roughly speaking, the value function estimates ""how good"" it is to be in a given state

Reinforcement learning
. The theory of Markov decision processes states that if π ∗ {\displaystyle \pi ^{*}} is an optimal policy, we act optimally (take the optimal action) by choosing the action from Q π ∗ ( s , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle Q^{\pi ^{*}}(s,\cdot )} with the highest action-value at each state, s {\displaystyle s} . The action-value function of such an optimal policy ( Q π ∗ {\displaystyle Q^{\pi ^{*}}} ) is called the optimal action-value function and is commonly denoted by Q ∗ {\displaystyle Q^{*}}

How does reinforcement learning handle large environments?,By using samples to optimize performance and function approximation to manage large state-action spaces.,"According to the context, reinforcement learning handles large environments by using two key components:

1. Sampling to optimize performance
2. Function approximation to deal with large environments.

This allows RL to be used in large environments, making it suitable for planning problems and genuine learning problems.","Reinforcement learning
. Two elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance, and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, RL can be used in large environments in the following situations: The first two of these problems could be considered planning problems (since some form of model is available), while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem

Reinforcement learning
. The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible

What is the Monte Carlo method in RL?,A method that averages sample returns from actual or simulated experience to estimate value functions without needing the full dynamics of the environment.,"Based on the context, the Monte Carlo method in Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to a type of algorithm that functions similarly to bandit algorithms, but takes into account the non-stationarity of the problem by using general policy iteration (GPI). It also allows for simulated experience generation, making it suitable for episodic tasks.","Randomized algorithm
. The Monte Carlo algorithm (related to the Monte Carlo method for simulation) is guaranteed to complete in an amount of time that can be bounded by a function the input size and its parameter k, but allows a small probability of error. Observe that any Las Vegas algorithm can be converted into a Monte Carlo algorithm (via Markov's inequality), by having it output an arbitrary, possibly incorrect answer if it fails to complete within a specified time

Reinforcement learning
. These methods function similarly to the bandit algorithms, in which returns are averaged for each state-action pair. The key difference is that actions taken in one state affect the returns of subsequent states within the same episode, making the problem non-stationary. To address this non-stationarity, Monte Carlo methods use the framework of general policy iteration (GPI)

Reinforcement learning
. When using simulated experience, only a model capable of generating sample transitions is required, rather than a full specification of transition probabilities, which is necessary for dynamic programming methods. Monte Carlo methods apply to episodic tasks, where experience is divided into epi"
How do temporal difference methods differ from Monte Carlo methods?,"TD methods use the recursive Bellman equation for incremental updates, while Monte Carlo methods average complete returns from episodes.","According to the context, temporal difference (TD) methods differ from Monte Carlo methods in their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation and their ability to address non-stationarity. While both types of methods are used for reinforcement learning, TD methods specifically use this equation to overcome issues with high variance returns, whereas Monte Carlo methods function similarly to bandit algorithms and use general policy iteration (GPI) to address non-stationarity.","Reinforcement learning
. Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue. Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation

Reinforcement learning
. These methods function similarly to the bandit algorithms, in which returns are averaged for each state-action pair. The key difference is that actions taken in one state affect the returns of subsequent states within the same episode, making the problem non-stationary.

Value iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants. Including Deep Q-learning methods when a neural network is used to represent Q, with various applications in stochastic search problems

Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent should take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize a reward signal. Reinforcement learning is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning

Reinforcement learning
. Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision process: The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal (or near-optimal) policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from immediate rewards. This is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology"
What is the role of the discount factor γ in RL?,The discount factor γ determines how much future rewards are valued relative to immediate rewards.,"According to the context, the discount factor γ has the role of weighting rewards in the distant future less than rewards in the immediate future. In other words, it gives more importance to short-term rewards and less importance to long-term rewards.","Reinforcement learning
.: 60 where the random variable G {\displaystyle G} denotes the discounted return, and is defined as the sum of future discounted rewards: where R t + 1 {\displaystyle R_{t+1}} is the reward for transitioning from state S t {\displaystyle S_{t}} to S t + 1 {\displaystyle S_{t+1}} , 0 ≤ γ < 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq \gamma <1} is the discount rate. γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is less than 1, so rewards in the distant future are weighted less than rewards in the immediate future

Reinforcement learning
. Clearly, a policy that is optimal in this sense is also optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected discounted return, since V ∗ ( s ) = max π E [ G ∣ s , π ] {\displaystyle V^{*}(s)=\max _{\pi }\mathbb {E} [G\mid s,\pi ]} , where s {\displaystyle s} is a state randomly sampled from the distribution μ {\displaystyle \mu } of initial states (so μ ( s ) = Pr ( S 0 = s ) {\displaystyle \mu (s)=\Pr(S_{0}=s)} )

Robotics
. The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments. Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance

Robotics
. Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions.

Additionally, tactile sensors are also mentioned as being used in robots, particularly in developing robotic and prosthetic hands that mimic human-like touch and sensation.","Robotics
. Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar. Lidar measures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor.

"What is the function of a ""gripper"" in robotics?","A gripper is an end-effector that picks up and releases objects. It can be simple, like two fingers, or more complex, like a human-like hand.","According to the context, the function of a ""gripper"" in robotics is to move in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor. It can also be used as part of more sophisticated tasks, such as building and reasoning with a ""cognitive"" model at longer time scales.","Robotics
. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure. At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a ""cognitive"" model

2. Friction jaws (including encompassing jaws)
3. Hand or tool (not specifically defined as a type of end-effector, but referred to as an example of an end effector)","Robotics
. Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception. As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error

Robotics
. Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, move or otherwise have an effect. Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as end effectors, while the ""arm"" is referred to as a manipulator.

. Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as Carnegie Mellon University's ""Ballbot"" which is the approximate height and width of a person, and Tohoku Gakuin University's ""BallIP"". Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people

Robotics
. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to. Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum. Many different balancing robots have been designed

. For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page. A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability.

. Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings. The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot can even navigate both on land and in water. A small number of skating robots have been developed, one of which is a multi-mode walking and skating device. It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll

How does simplification affect scientific models?,"Simplification abstracts away less relevant details, focusing on key aspects needed for the task at hand.","According to the context, simplification in scientific modelling involves leaving out all the known and observed entities and their relations that are not important for the task. This means that scientists purposefully ignore certain details or aspects of reality if they are not crucial for answering a specific question or achieving a particular goal. In other words, simplification is done to focus on what's essential for the task at hand, making it easier to understand and analyze the model.","Scientific modelling
. It is task-driven because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important but not needed in the same detail as the object of interest. Both activities, simplification, and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality

Mathematical model
. While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including numerical instability. Thomas Kuhn argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a paradigm shift offers radical simplification

Scientific modelling
. All models are in simulacra, that is, simplified reflections of reality that, despite being approximations, can be extremely useful. Building and disputing models is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Complete and true representation may be impossible, but scientific debate often concerns which is the better model for a given task, e."
What is a discrete system model?,A discrete system model changes variables at separate points in time.,"According to the context, a discrete system model is one in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time, as opposed to a continuous system model where the state variables change continuously with respect to time.","Scientific modelling
. The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and form relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time

Discrete mathematics
. The time scale calculus is a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of differential equations, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation is the notion of hybrid dynamical systems. Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of discrete collections of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is tiling of the plane

Discrete mathematics

What is a continuous system model?,A continuous system model changes variables continuously over time.,"According to the context, a continuous system model is one in which the state variables change continuously with respect to time. This type of model is used to represent continuous physical systems where the variables are smooth and uninterrupted in time.","Scientific modelling

There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time

Industrial process control
. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds). A continuous physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time. The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics

How do assumptions affect the accuracy of models?,A model’s accuracy depends on the validity of its assumptions; incorrect assumptions lead to inaccurate predictions.,"According to the context, assumptions affect the accuracy of models by making accurate predictions when they are valid, and not making accurate predictions when they do not hold. In other words, if the assumptions underlying a model are correct, the model will make accurate predictions. However, if the assumptions are invalid, the model may not accurately predict the behavior of the system it is intended to describe.","Scientific modelling
. A model makes accurate predictions when its assumptions are valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the general theory of relativity works in non-inertial reference frames as well). A model is evaluated first and foremost by its consistency to empirical data; any model inconsistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected

Mathematical model
. Note that better accuracy does not necessarily mean a better model. Statistical models are prone to overfitting which means that a model is fitted to data too much and it has lost its ability to generalize to new events that were not observed before. Any model which is not pure white-box contains some parameters that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe

Mathematical model
. Tools from nonparametric statistics can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form. Assessing the scope of a model, that is, det"
How are models evaluated?,Models are evaluated based on their consistency with empirical data and their ability to make accurate predictions.,"Based on the provided context, models are evaluated in the following ways:

* In a mathematical model, evaluation involves checking whether the model predicts experimental measurements or other empirical data not used in the model development. This often involves splitting the data into training and verification sets.
* In scientific modeling, evaluation is based on the model's consistency with empirical data. If a model is inconsistent with reproducible observations, it must be modified or rejected.
* In general, models are evaluated by their ability to make accurate predictions when their assumptions are valid, and by their consistency with empirical data.

In summary, model evaluation involves checking whether a model makes accurate predictions and is consistent with empirical data.","Mathematical model
. This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation. Usually, the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model predicts experimental measurements or other empirical data not used in the model development. In models with parameters, a common approach is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters

Scientific modelling

What is space mapping in engineering optimization?,Space mapping is used to align coarse and fine models of varying complexity to optimize without expensive computations.,"Space mapping in engineering optimization refers to a methodology that links a ""coarse"" (ideal or low-fidelity) model with a ""fine"" (practical or high-fidelity) model of different complexities by iteratively refining a ""mapped"" coarse model, also known as a surrogate model. This approach aims to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model and instead uses a very fast coarse model that is aligned with the fine model through space mapping.","Scientific modelling
. Space mapping refers to a methodology that employs a ""quasi-global"" modelling formulation to link companion ""coarse"" (ideal or low-fidelity) with ""fine"" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In engineering optimization, space mapping aligns (maps) a very fast coarse model with its related expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment process iteratively refines a ""mapped"" coarse model (surrogate model)

Mathematical optimization
. Electromagnetically validated design optimization of microwave components and antennas has made extensive use of an appropriate physics-based or empirical surrogate model and space mapping methodologies since the discovery of space mapping in 1993.

What is the von Neumann universe in set theory?,"The von Neumann universe is a cumulative hierarchy of pure sets, with each set assigned a rank based on its nesting level.","The von Neumann universe (denoted V) is defined as the entire collection of pure sets with all possible ranks, organized into a cumulative hierarchy based on how deeply their members, members of members, etc. are nested.","Set theory
. For each ordinal α {\displaystyle \alpha } , the set V α {\displaystyle V_{\alpha }} is defined to consist of all pure sets with rank less than α {\displaystyle \alpha } . The entire von Neumann universe is denoted V {\displaystyle V} . Elementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using Venn diagrams

Set theory
. In modern set theory, it is common to restrict attention to the von Neumann universe of pure sets, and many systems of axiomatic set theory are designed to axiomatize the pure sets only. There are many technical advantages to this restriction, and little generality is lost, because essentially all mathematical concepts can be modeled by pure sets. Sets in the von Neumann universe are organized into a cumulative hierarchy, based on how deeply their members, members of members, etc. are nested

What is a proper subset?,A proper subset is a set that is a subset of another set but not equal to it.,"A proper subset A of B is defined as a subset of B that is not equal to B, i.e., A ⊂ B and A ≠ B.","Set theory
. For cases where this possibility is unsuitable or would make sense to be rejected, the term proper subset is defined, variously denoted A ⊂ B {\displaystyle A\subset B} , A ⊊ B {\displaystyle A\subsetneq B} , or A ⫋ B {\displaystyle A\subsetneqq B} (note however that the notation A ⊂ B {\displaystyle A\subset B} is sometimes used synonymously with A ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} ; that is, allowing the possibility that A and B are equal)

Set theory
. We call A a proper subset of B if and only if A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B. Also, 1, 2, and 3 are members (elements) of the set {1, 2, 3}, but are not subsets of it; and in turn, the subsets, such as {1}, are not members of the set {1, 2, 3}. More complicated relations can exist; for example, the set {1} is both a member and a proper subset of the set {1, {1}}. Just as arithmetic features binary operations on numbers, set theory features binary operations on sets

. The following is a partial list of them: Some basic sets of central importance are the set of natural numbers, the set of real numbers and the empty set – the unique set containing no elements. The empty set is also occasionally called the null set, though this name is ambiguous and can lead to several interpretations. The empty set can be denoted with empty braces "" { } {\displaystyle \{\}} "" or the symbol "" ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } "" or "" ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } ""

Boolean algebra
. Example 2. The empty set and X. This two-element algebra shows that a concrete Boolean algebra can be finite even when it consists of subsets of an infinite set. It can be seen that every field of subsets of X must contain the empty set and X. Hence no smaller example is possible, other than the degenerate algebra obtained by taking X to be empty so as to make the empty set and X coincide. Example 3

If R is not a member of itself, then its definition entails that it is a member of itself; yet, if it is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself... resulting in a paradoxical contradiction!","Set theory
. (This set is sometimes called ""the Russell set"".) If R is not a member of itself, then its definition entails that it is a member of itself; yet, if it is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself, since it is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. The resulting contradiction is Russell's paradox. In symbols: This came around a time of several paradoxes or counter-intuitive results

Mathematical logic
. Very soon thereafter, Bertrand Russell discovered Russell's paradox in 1901, and Jules Richard discovered Richard's paradox. Zermelo provided the first set of axioms for set theory. These axioms, together with the additional axiom of replacement proposed by Abraham Fraenkel, are now called Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). Zermelo's axioms incorporated the principle of limitation of size to avoid Russell's paradox

This includes the study of cardinal arithmetic and the study of extensions of Ramsey's theorem such as the Erdős–Rado theorem. Descriptive set theory is the study of subsets of the real line and, more generally, subsets of Polish spaces

Discrete mathematics
.g. infinitary logic. Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all prime numbers. Partially ordered sets and sets with other relations have applications in several areas. In discrete mathematics, countable sets (including finite sets) are the main focus

Discrete mathematics
. Combinatorics studies the ways in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged.

What does fuzzy set theory introduce to set membership?,"Fuzzy set theory allows for degrees of membership, meaning an object can belong to a set with a value between 0 and 1 rather than just being a member or not.","According to the context, fuzzy set theory introduces ""graduation"" between sets, allowing for partial membership. This allows values to fall between the traditional binary classification of entirely within or out.","Soft computing
. Unlike classical sets that allow members to be entirely within or out, fuzzy sets allow partial membership by incorporating ""graduation"" between sets. Fuzzy logic operations include negation, conjunction, and disjunction, which handle membership between data sets. Fuzzy rules are logical statements that map the correlation between input and output parameters. They set the rules needed to trace variable relationships linguistically, and they would not be possible without linguistic variables

Set theory
. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include rough set theory and fuzzy set theory, in which the value of an atomic formula embodying the membership relation is not simply True or False. The Boolean-valued models of ZFC are a related subject. An enrichment of ZFC called internal set theory was proposed by Edward Nelson in 1977. Many mathematical concepts can be defined precisely using only set theoretic concepts

. If the project incorporates a piece of legacy software that has not been modeled, this software may be modeled to help ensure it is correctly incorporated with the newer software. Design involves choices about the implementation of the software, such as which programming languages and database software to use, or how the hardware and network communications will be organized. Design may be iterative with users consulted about their needs in a process of trial and error

Software development process
. Agile software development uses iterative development as a basis but advocates a lighter and more people-centric viewpoint than traditional approaches. Agile processes fundamentally incorporate iteration and the continuous feedback that it provides "

It typically involves dividing software development work into smaller, parallel, or sequential steps or sub-processes to improve design and/or product management. The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application

Software development process
. The main idea of the software development life cycle has been ""to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, requiring each stage of the life cycle––from the inception of the idea to delivery of the final system––to be carried out rigidly and sequentially"" within the context of the framework being applied

. In 2009, it was estimated that 32 percent of software projects were delivered on time and budget, and with the full functionality. An additional 44 percent were delivered, but missing at least one of these features. The remaining 24 percent were cancelled pr"
How do software ideas get evaluated?,"They are assessed for economic feasibility, compatibility with current products, and marketing fit before development begins.","According to the context, software ideas get evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, fit with existing channels of distribution, possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and fit with the company's marketing objectives.","Software development
. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, fit with existing channels of distribution, possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and fit with the company's marketing objectives

Software development
. In the marketing evaluation phase, the cost and time assumptions become evaluated. The feasibility analysis estimates the project's return on investment, its development cost and timeframe. Based on this analysis, the company can make a business decision to invest in further development. After deciding to develop the software, the company is focused on delivering the product at or below the estimated cost and time, and with a high standard of quality (i.e

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects can contain data (called fields, attributes or properties) and have actions they can perform (called procedures or methods and implemented in code). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another

Object-oriented programming
. Bertrand Meyer produced the first design of the Eiffel language in 1985, which focused on software quality using a design by contract approach. In the 1990s, object-oriented programming became the main way of programming, especially as more languages supported it. These included Visual FoxPro 3.0, C++, and Delphi. OOP became even more popular with the rise of graphical user interfaces, which used objects for buttons, menus and other elements

Object-oriented programming
. This makes programs easier to manage. Each modules has its own namespace, so items in one module will not conflict with items in another. Object-oriented programming (OOP) was created to make code easier to reuse and maintain. However, it was not designed to clearly show the flow of a program's instructions—that "
What are the phases of software testing?,"Testing includes debugging, code reviews, stress testing, load testing, and integration testing.","Based on the provided context, there are no specific phases of software testing mentioned.

Testing during this phase is generally performed by the programmer and with the purpose to verify that the code behaves as designed and to know when the code is ready for the next level of testing

Software testing
. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk

Possible localization and globalization failures include: Development testing is a software development process that involves the synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the "
What is test-driven development (TDD)?,It involves writing tests before the actual code to ensure the software works as expected.,"According to the context, Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way of unit testing such that unit-level testing is performed while writing the product code.","Software testing
. Agile software development commonly involves testing while the code is being written and organizing teams with both programmers and testers and with team members performing both programming and testing. One agile practice, test-driven software development (TDD), is a way of unit testing such that unit-level testing is performed while writing the product code. Test code is updated as new features are added and failure conditions are discovered (bugs fixed)

Software development
. Quality testing also often includes stress and load checking (whether the software is robust to heavy levels of input or usage), integration testing (to ensure that the software is adequately integrated with other software), and compatibility testing (measuring the software's performance across different operating systems or browsers). When tests are written before the code, this is called test-driven development. Production is the phase in which software is deployed to the end user

What does quality assurance entail in software development?,"QA tests the software's accuracy, including stress, integration, and compatibility checks.","Based on the provided context, Quality Assurance (QA) entails testing the accuracy of the entire software product after it has been submitted, ensuring that it meets the original software requirements. QA is a separate department, typically consisting of non-programmers, that focuses on preventing defects from reaching customers by implementing policies and procedures intended to detect errors early in the development process.","Software quality
. Software Assurance (SA) covers both the property and the process to achieve it: The Project Management Institute's PMBOK Guide ""Software Extension"" defines not ""Software quality"" itself, but Software Quality Assurance (SQA) as ""a continuous process that audits other software processes to ensure that those processes are being followed (includes for example a software quality management plan)

Software development
. Code reviews by other developers are often used to scrutinize new code added to the project, and according to some estimates dramatically reduce the number of bugs persisting after testing is complete. Once the code has been submitted, quality assurance—a separate department of non-programmers for most large companies—test the accuracy of the entire software product. Acceptance tests derived from the original software requirements are a popular tool for this

Version control is a popular way of managing changes made to the software. Whenever a new version is checked in, the software saves a backup of all modified files

Open-source software
. Version control systems such as Centralized Version control system (CVCS) and the distributed version control system (DVCS) are examples of tools, often open source, that help manage the source code files and the changes to those files for a software project in order to foster collaboration. CVCS are centralized with a central repository while DVCS are decentralized and have a local repository for every user

What is software maintenance?,"Software maintenance involves supporting the software after its release, including error correction, optimization, and feature enhancement.",Software maintenance is the modification of software after delivery.,"Software maintenance
Software maintenance is the modification of software after delivery. Software maintenance is often considered lower skilled and less rewarding than new development. As such, it is a common target for outsourcing or offshoring. Usually, the team developing the software is different from those who will be maintaining it. The developers lack an incentive to write the code to be easily maintained

Software maintenance
. The goal of the testing is to verify that previous functionality is retained, and the new functionality has been added. The key purpose of software maintenance is ensuring that the product continues to meet usability requirements. At times, this may mean extending the product's capabilities beyond what was initially envisioned

What impact did outsourcing have on software engineering?,"Outsourcing led to a shift in software development to countries with lower labor costs, impacting job availability and work dynamics.","According to the context, outsourcing had the following impacts on software engineering:

* A massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India, China, Russia, and other developing countries.
* A negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession, mainly due to distance/time zone differences that prevented human interaction between clients and developers.
* Led to a fear among students in developed countries to avoid education related to software engineering, as they feared being displaced by foreign visa workers.","Software engineering
. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license. The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries

Software engineering
. For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by foreign visa workers. Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected

How do professional certifications benefit software engineers?,Certifications like CSDP and CSDA validate expertise in software development and increase employability.,"According to the context, professional certifications can benefit software engineers by providing legally recognized professional credentials, such as Chartered IT Professional (CITP) in the UK or Professional Engineer (P.Eng) and Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designations in some areas of Canada. Additionally, certifications on specific topics like security, process improvement, and software architecture can demonstrate expertise and enhance career prospects. Many companies, including IBM and Microsoft, also offer their own certification examinations, which can provide additional recognition and credibility for software engineers.","Software engineering
. In the U.K. the British Computer Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called Chartered IT Professional (CITP), available to fully qualified members (MBCS). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the British Computer Society or Institution of Engineering and Technology and so qualify to be considered for Chartered Engineer status through either of those institutions

Software engineering
. Legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer. In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation

What is the role of software engineers in global development teams?,"Software engineers may work in distributed teams across different time zones, improving operational efficiency but facing challenges like communication and cultural differences.","According to the context, it can be inferred that software engineers play a crucial role in global development teams by performing tasks such as:

* Designing and architecting new features and applications
* Managing the software development lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, and deployment)
* Leading a team of programmers
* Communicating with customers, managers, and other engineers
* Considering system stability and quality
* Exploring software development and innovation

In global development teams, software engineers may be responsible for working on large-scale projects, managing distributed teams, and collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders to deliver high-quality software products.","Programmer
. A software engineer usually is responsible for the same tasks as a developer plus broader responsibilities of software engineering including architecting and designing new features and applications, targeting new platforms, managing the software development lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, and deployment), leading a team of programmers, communicating with customers, managers and other engineers, considering system stability and quality, and exploring software development

Software engineering
. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Many companies hire interns, often university or college students during a summer break, or externships

Software engineering
. A software engineer applies a software development process, which involves defining, implementing, testing, managing, and maintaining software systems, as well as developing the software development process itself. Beginning in the 1960s, "
What is a software framework?,"A software framework is an abstraction that provides generic functionality, allowing user-written code to customize specific application features.","A software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software.

Error detection and correction
. Error-correcting codes are used in lower-layer communication such as cellular network, high-speed fiber-optic communication and Wi-Fi, as well as for reliable storage in media such as flash memory, hard disk and RAM

Error detection and correction
. Forward error correction (FEC) is a process of adding redundant data such as an error-correcting code (ECC) to a message so that it can be recovered by a receiver even when a number of errors (up to the capability of the code being used) are introduced, either during the process of transmission or on storage. Since the receiver does not have to ask the sender for retransmission of the data, a backchannel is not required in forward error correction"

Software maintenance
. Despite many employers considering maintenance lower-skilled work and the phase of software development most suited to offshoring, it requires close communication with the customer and rapid response, both of which are hampered by these communication difficulties. In software engineering, the term legacy system does not have a fixed meaning, but often refers to older systems which are large, difficult to modify, and also necessary for current business needs

Why do software engineers often avoid maintenance tasks?,"Maintenance is seen as unrewarding and less challenging, leading to lower job satisfaction and higher turnover.","According to the context, software engineers often avoid maintenance tasks because:

* They know they won't be responsible for maintaining the software (lack of incentive)
* Maintenance is considered an unrewarding job that pays less than a comparable job in software development
* The task is often assigned to temporary workers or lesser-skilled staff

In summary, software engineers tend to shy away from maintenance tasks due to a lack of personal stake, lower compensation, and the fact that they are not seen as desirable positions.","Software maintenance
. Development engineers who know that they will not be responsible for maintaining the software do not have an incentive to build in maintainability. Maintenance is often considered an unrewarding job for software engineers, who, if assigned to maintenance, were more likely to quit. It often pays less than a comparable job in software development

Software maintenance
. The task is often assigned to temporary workers or lesser-skilled staff, although maintenance engineers are also typically older than developers, partly because they must be familiar with outdated technologies. In 2008, around 900,000 of the 1.3 million software engineers and programmers working in the United States were doing maintenance

Software maintenance
. Many software development organizations neglect maintainability, even though doing so will increase long-term costs. Technical debt is incurred when programmers, often out of laziness or urgency to meet a deadline, choose quick and dirty solutions rather than build maintainability into their code. A common cause is underestimates in software development effort estimation, leading to insufficient resources allocated to development"
What is the impact of offshoring software maintenance?,"Offshoring can lead to communication barriers, such as time zone differences and cultural issues, which hinder rapid response and customer communication.","According to the context, the downsides of offshoring include:

* Communication barriers in the form of time zone and organizational disjunction and cultural differences.

This implies that offshoring software maintenance can negatively impact communication between teams or organizations.","Software maintenance
. Reasons for offshoring include taking advantage of lower labor costs, enabling around-the-clock support, reducing time pressure on developers, and to move support closer to the market for the product. Downsides of offshoring include communication barriers in the form of such factors as time zone and organizational disjunction and cultural differences

Software maintenance
Software maintenance is the modification of software after delivery. Software maintenance is often considered lower skilled and less rewarding than new development.

"What is ""software evolution""?","Software evolution refers to the process of expanding functionality after the initial release, often seen as a form of maintenance.","According to the context, ""software evolution"" refers to changes that expand functionality, as well as this type of change, which is often called software maintenance instead. In other words, software evolution refers to the process of making modifications or enhancements to existing software to improve its capabilities or fix issues, rather than just maintaining its current state.","Software maintenance
. This type of change, and others that expand functionality, is often called software evolution instead of maintenance. Despite testing and quality assurance, virtually all software contains bugs where the system does not work as intended. Post-release maintenance is necessary to remediate these bugs when they are found. Most software is a combination of pre-existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and open-source software components with custom-written code

Why is maintainability important in software development?,"It ensures that software can be easily modified without introducing new issues, reducing long-term maintenance costs.","Maintainability is important in software development because it enables the software to be easily modified without breaking existing functionality. This allows developers to make changes and updates to the software over time without compromising its performance or reliability. According to the ISO/IEC 14764 specification, maintainability is one of the key aspects of software maintenance, which accounts for a significant portion (80%) of software development.","Software maintenance
. One important aspect is having a large amount of automated software tests that can detect if existing functionality is compromised by a change. A challenge with maintainability is that many software engineering courses do not emphasize it, and give out one-and-done assignments that have clear and unchanging specifications. Software engineering courses do not cover systems as complex as occur in the real world

How does agile methodology relate to software maintenance?,"While agile doesn't have a formal maintenance phase, change requests can be handled as part of agile sprints.","According to the context, Agile methodologies can be employed to promote flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development in software maintenance. Although Agile methodology doesn't have a specific ""maintenance phase"", the change cycle can be enacted as a Scrum sprint, enabling the modification of existing code. This suggests that Agile principles and practices can be applied to software maintenance, facilitating efficient and effective changes to existing software.","Software maintenance
. Software development effort estimation is a difficult problem, including for maintenance change requests, but the request is likely to be declined if it is too expensive or infeasible. If it is decided to implement the request, it can be assigned to a scheduled release and implemented. Although agile methodology does not have a maintenance phase, the change cycle can be enacted as a scrum sprint. Understanding existing code is an essential step before modifying it

Software development process
. Agile methodologies, such as scrum or kanban, are often employed to promote flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.

Additionally, it is noted that solids must be closed under these Boolean operations to guarantee solidity after material addition and removal.","Solid modeling
. In addition, solids are required to be closed under the Boolean operations of set union, intersection, and difference (to guarantee solidity after material addition and removal). Applying the standard Boolean operations to closed regular sets may not produce a closed regular set, but this problem can be solved by regularizing the result of applying the standard Boolean operations. The regularized set operations are denoted ∪∗, ∩∗, and −∗

At run time the video card interprets the byte as the raster operation indicated by the original expression in a uniform way that requires remarkably little hardware and which takes time completely independent of the complexity of the expression. Solid modeling systems for computer aided design offer a variety of methods for building objects from other objects, combination by Boolean operations being one of them

The later Bateman Manuscript Project, under the editorship of Arthur Erdélyi, attempted to be encyclopedic, and came around the time when electronic computation was coming to the fore and tabulation ceased to be the main issue. The modern theory of orthogonal polynomials is of a definite but limited scope. Hypergeometric series, observed by Felix Klein to be important in astronomy and mathematical physics, became an intricate theory, requiring later conceptual arrangement

Electronic publishing
. In 2003, Wikisource was launched, and the project aspired to constitute a digital and multilingual library that would be a complement to the Wikipedia project. It was originally named ""Project Sourceberg"", as a word play to remind the Project Gutenberg. Supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikisource proposes digitized texts that have been verified by volunteers

Electronic publishing
. The first digitization initiative was in 1971 by Michael S. Hart, a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who launched Project Gutenberg, designed to make literature more accessible to everyone, through the internet. It took a while to develop, and in 1989 there were only 1"

What is statistics?,"It is the discipline concerned with collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.","According to the context, statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.","Statistics
. ""Statistics is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data."" - featured in the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science. Statistics is the discipline that deals with data, facts and figures with which meaningful information is inferred. Data may represent a numerical value, in form of quantitative data, or a label, as with qualitative data. Data may be collected, presented and summarised, in one of two methods called descriptive statistics

Statistics
Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. ""description of a state, a country"") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as ""all people living in a country"" or ""every atom composing a crystal""

What are the two main types of statistical methods?,Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.,"According to the context, the two main statistical methods are:

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Inferential statistics","Statistics
. Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation)

Statistics
. Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure-theoretic probability theory. All statistical analyses make use of at least some mathematics, and mathematical statistics can therefore be regarded as a fundamental component of general statistics. Formal discussions on inference date back to the mathematicians and cryptographers of the Islamic Golden Age between the 8th and 13th centuries

Statistics
. Professional certification programs, such as the CFA, often include topics in statistics. Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: biostatistics, computational biology, computational sociology, network biology, social science, sociology and social research.

How does statistics handle large populations when a full census is not possible?,By using representative samples through well-designed surveys and experiments.,"According to the context, statistics handles large populations when a full census is not possible by collecting sample data through specific experiment designs and survey samples. This approach ensures that the sample represents the overall population, allowing inferences and conclusions to reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. Representative sampling is crucial in this case to make sure that the sample is truly representative of the entire population.","Statistics
. The term statistic, in singular form, is used to describe a function that returns its value of the same name. When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models. To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population

Statistics
. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. When census data (comprising every member of the target population) cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole

Statistics

What is the key difference between experimental and observational studies?,"Experimental studies involve manipulation, observational studies do not.","According to the context, the key difference between experimental and observational studies is that an experimental study involves manipulating the system under study, whereas an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.","Statistics
. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements with different levels using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated

Statistics
. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent. Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution

What is the aim of inferential statistics?,To draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.,"According to the context, the aim of inferential statistics is to ""infer properties of a population... by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.""","Statistics
. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population

What are Type I and Type II errors?,Type I: false positive; Type II: false negative.,"Based on the provided context, Type I errors refer to rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true, resulting in a ""false positive"". On the other hand, Type II errors refer to failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false, resulting in a ""false negative"".","Statistics
. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a ""false positive"") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a ""false negative""). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis

Statistics
. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator does not belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false

Error detection and correction
. There are three major types of error correction: Automatic repeat request (ARQ) is an error control method for data transmission that makes use of error-detection codes, acknowledgment and/or negative acknowledgment messages, and timeouts "
