What is abstraction in computer science?,The process of generalizing details to focus on what's important.,"According to the context, abstraction in computer science can be described in three ways:

1. **Generalizing concrete details**: abstracting away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance.
2. **Isolating system components**: separating system or network components into layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting others.
3. **Considering less detailed definitions**: observing a program's behavior at a higher level, focusing only on the final result instead of all intermediate steps.

In summary, abstraction in computer science is the process of simplifying complex systems or programs by hiding irrelevant details and focusing on essential aspects.","Abstraction (computer science)

Abstraction (computer science)
. Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept. Data abstraction enforces a clear separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type—the interface to the data type—while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time

What does a foreign function interface allow?,Calling lower-level languages.,"Based on the context, a foreign function interface (FFI) is not explicitly mentioned. However, if you are referring to the broader context of functional programming and closures, then an FFI might be inferred to allow:

* Functions written in one language to be called from another language, effectively treating functions as first-class citizens across language boundaries.

In other words, a foreign function interface would enable interoperability between different programming languages, enabling functions to be passed around or returned as arguments just like any other data type.","Functional programming
. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner

Closure (computer programming)
. As of the 2011 revision, the C++ language also supports closures, which are a type of function object constructed automatically from a special language construct called lambda-expression. A C++ closure may capture its context either by storing copies of the accessed variables as members of the closure object or by reference

Closure (computer programming)
. The funarg problem (or ""functional argument"" problem) describes the difficulty of implementing functions as first class objects in a stack-based programming language such as C or C++",0.571739673614502,0.6132482290267944,no,0.0,0.04444444444444444,0.04444444444444444
What are specification languages based on?,Abstractions.,"Based on the context, specification languages are not explicitly mentioned as being based on anything. However, it is mentioned that programming language specifications can take several forms, including an implementation of a programming language (conversion of source code into machine code). Therefore, I would infer that specification languages are likely based on the same concepts and principles used to define a programming language, such as logic or standardized sets of symbols and arrangements.","Programming language
. Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea. The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be. A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following: An implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into machine code that can be executed by the hardware

Modeling language
. Model transformation is a common example of such reasoning. Object modeling languages are modeling languages based on a standardized set of symbols and ways of arranging them to model (part of) an object oriented software design or system design. Some organizations use them extensively in combination with a software development methodology to progress from initial specification to an implementation plan and to communicate that plan to an entire team of developers and stakeholders

Formal methods

Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic programming languages. It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular modern programming languages

Domain-specific language
. However, languages like UML are typically general-purpose modeling languages. To summarize, an analogy might be useful: a Very Little Language is like a knife, which can be used in thousands of different ways, from cutting food to cutting down trees.[clarification needed] A domain-specific language is like an electric drill: it is a powerful tool with a wide variety of uses, but a specific context, namely, putting holes in things

What is control abstraction?,Hiding low-level operations in high-level constructs.,"Based on the context provided, control abstraction is not explicitly mentioned as a specific type of abstraction in computer science. However, it can be inferred that control abstraction refers to the process of generalizing concrete details related to the control flow or behavior of a system or program, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance.

In other words, control abstraction involves isolating specific aspects of a program's execution path, such as conditional statements, loops, or function calls, and representing them at a higher level of abstraction, without focusing on the low-level implementation details. This allows for more abstract reasoning about the behavior of the system and facilitates the analysis and modification of its control flow.

It is worth noting that this interpretation is based on the general concept of abstraction in computer science, and it may not be a specific term or definition recognized in the field.","Abstraction (computer science)
. It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

Abstraction (computer science)
. As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer ""I don't know"" to some questions). Abstraction is the core concept of abstract interpretation. Model checking generally takes place on abstract versions of the studied systems

What does structured programming reduce?,Complexity and side effects.,"According to the context, structured programming reduces the complexity potential for side-effects.","Abstraction (computer science)
. Without control abstraction, a programmer would need to specify all the register/binary-level steps each time they simply wanted to add or multiply a couple of numbers and assign the result to a variable. Such duplication of effort has two serious negative consequences: Structured programming involves the splitting of complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow-control and interfaces between components, with a reduction of the complexity potential for side-effects

Software construction
. Reduced complexity is achieved through emphasizing the creation of code that is simple and readable rather than clever. Minimizing complexity is accomplished through making use of standards, and through numerous specific techniques in coding. It is also supported by the construction-focused quality techniques.

Object-oriented programming
. Because data abstraction works well, many programming styles, like object-oriented programming and functional programming, use it as a key principle. Encapsulation is another important idea in programming. It means keeping the internal details of an object hidden from the outside code. This makes it easier to change how an object works on the inside without affecting other parts of the program, such as in code refactoring

What is delegation in OOP?,Simplifying relationships within types.,"According to the context, delegation in OOP refers to structuring classes or types inside a program to simplify complex relationships. It is an alternative to inheritance and can be used as a way to control how much of one class is exposed to other parts of the program, similar to the Employee class controlling how much of Person it exposes.","Object-oriented programming
. This lets the Employee class control how much of Person it exposes to other parts of the program. Delegation is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance. Programmers have different opinions on inheritance. Bjarne Stroustrup, author of C++, has stated that it is possible to do OOP without inheritance. Rob Pike has criticized inheritance for creating complicated hierarchies instead of simpler solutions

Abstraction (computer science)
. When it proceeds in the opposite direction, inside the types or classes, structuring them to simplify a complex set of relationships, it is called delegation or inheritance. Various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction, all to support a general strategy of polymorphism in object-oriented programming, which includes the substitution of one data type for another in the same or similar role

. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed acyclic graph. An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The following table shows which variables and functions get inherited dependent on the visibility given when deriving the class, using the terminology established by C++. Inheritance is used to co-relate two or more classes to each other. Many object-oriented programming languages permit a class or object to replace the implementation of an aspect—typically a behavior—that it has inherited. This process is called overriding

Additionally, templates are used heavily in C++ to implement static bindings at compile-time, which offers flexibility problems.","Array (data structure)
. In C++ (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime as well as for runtime-flexible arrays. Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.

. This led to work by Gödel and others to define and describe these formal systems, including concepts such as mu-recursive functions and lambda-definable functions. In 1936 Alan Turing and Alonzo Church independently, and also together, introduced the formalization of an algorithm, with limits on what can be computed, and a ""purely mechanical"" model for computing. This became the Church–Turing thesis, a hypothesis about the nature of mechanical calculation devices, such as electronic computers

History of computer science
."" The theoretical Turing Machine, created by Alan Turing, is a hypothetical device theorized in order to study the properties of such hardware. The mathematical foundations of modern computer science began to be laid by Kurt Gödel with his incompleteness theorem (1931).

Who was Christopher Morcom to Turing?,A close friend and first love who deeply influenced him.,"According to the context, Christopher Collan Morcom (1911-1930) was Turing's ""first love"" and a significant friend whom Turing regarded as ""brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited"".","Alan Turing
. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930), who has been described as Turing's first love

Alan Turing
. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote: I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited.

. Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ⓘ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing

. Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols. Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs

Algorithm
. One informal definition is ""a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations"",[need quotation to verify] which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cook-book recipe.

How does an algorithm differ from a heuristic?,"An algorithm guarantees a correct result when followed, while a heuristic provides an approximate or practical solution without a guarantee.","According to the context, an algorithm differs from a heuristic in that:

* An algorithm is guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, whereas a heuristic is not.
* An algorithm uses conditionals and can divert code execution through various routes for automated decision-making and automated reasoning. A heuristic, on the other hand, relies on approaches to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.

In summary, an algorithm is a well-defined procedure that always produces the desired output, whereas a heuristic is an approach to solving problems that may not necessarily produce the best or most accurate result, but can still be useful in certain situations.","Algorithm
. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning). In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called ""algorithms"", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly ""correct"" recommendation

Mathematical optimization
. Besides (finitely terminating) algorithms and (convergent) iterative methods, there are heuristics. A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations

Algorithm
. Some common paradigms are: For optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following: One of the simplest algorithms finds the largest number in a list of numbers of random order.

A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. The algorithm typically uses uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the ""average case"" over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits; thus either the running time, or the output (or both) are random variables

Randomized algorithm
. In some cases, probabilistic algorithms are the only practical means of solving a problem. In common practice, randomized algorithms are approximated using a pseudorandom number generator in place of a true source of random bits; such an implementation may deviate from the expected theoretical behavior and mathematical guarantees which may depend on the existence of an ideal true random number generator. As a motivating example, consider the problem of finding an ‘a’ in an array of n elements

Nevertheless, Donald Knuth emphasized that efficiency is still an important consideration: ""In established engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal and I believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering"" An algorithm is considered efficient if its resource consumption, also known as computational cost, is at or below some acceptable level

Algorithmic efficiency
In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeat",0.6827468872070312,0.7680177092552185,yes,0.013209024809044529,0.2028985507246377,0.08695652173913045
What notation is commonly used to describe algorithm complexity?,Big O notation,The answer is: Big O notation,"Algorithmic efficiency
. The most commonly used notation to describe resource consumption or ""complexity"" is Donald Knuth's Big O notation, representing the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input n {\textstyle n}

Analysis of algorithms
.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Big O notation, Big-omega notation and Big-theta notation are used to this end. For instance, binary search is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the size n of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log n), colloquially ""in logarithmic time"". Usually asymptotic estimates are used because different implementations of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency

Computational complexity theory
. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity, circuit complexity, and decision tree complexity.

In other words, a benchmark is a tool or method used to measure and compare the performance of an algorithm, either before and after optimization or against different algorithms or systems.","Algorithm
. Benchmarks may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization. Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are non-trivial to perform fairly. To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to FFT algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging

Algorithmic efficiency
. More detailed estimates are needed to compare algorithm performance when the amount of data is small, although this is likely to be of less importance. Parallel algorithms may be more difficult to analyze. A benchmark can be used to assess the performance of an algorithm in practice.

. Access to variables is also slower in an interpreter because the mapping of identifiers to storage locations must be done repeatedly at run-time rather than at compile time. There are various compromises between the development speed when using an interpreter and the execution speed when using a compiler. Some systems (such as some Lisps) allow interpreted and compiled code to call each other and to share variables

In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called ""algorithms"", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly ""correct"" recommendation

Algorithm
. Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, and control tables are structured expressions of algorithms that avoid common ambiguities of natural language.

What is an efficient algorithm?,An algorithm is considered efficient if its computational resources (time and space) grow slowly as the input size increases.,"According to the context, an efficient algorithm is one where the function's values are small or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. In other words, an efficient algorithm uses computational resources (such as time and space) in a way that scales well with the size of the input, rather than using excessive resources.","Analysis of algorithms
. An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same size may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so best, worst and average case descriptions might all be of practical interest. When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an upper bound, determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm

Algorithmic efficiency
In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process. For maximum efficiency it is desirable to minimize resource usage

Why is asymptotic analysis used in algorithms?,"Asymptotic analysis is used to estimate the performance of an algorithm for very large input sizes, focusing on how the time or space complexity grows as input size increases, independent of the specific implementation.","Asymptotic analysis is used in algorithms because different implementations of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency, and asymptotic estimates are needed to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Additionally, it allows for a focus on the asymptotic performance of an algorithm at the elementary level, which is particularly useful when considering hybrid algorithms that use different approaches based on the size of the input.","Analysis of algorithms
.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Big O notation, Big-omega notation and Big-theta notation are used to this end. For instance, binary search is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the size n of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log n), colloquially ""in logarithmic time"". Usually asymptotic estimates are used because different implementations of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency

Analysis of algorithms
. This is particularly used in hybrid algorithms, like Timsort, which use an asymptotically efficient algorithm (here merge sort, with time complexity n log ⁡ n {\displaystyle n\log n} ), but switch to an asymptotically inefficient algorithm (here insertion sort, with time complexity n 2 {\displaystyle n^{2}} ) for small data, as the simpler algorithm is faster on small data.

What is the role of a model of computation in algorithm analysis?,"A model of computation provides a framework to analyze the efficiency of algorithms based on assumptions about the computational environment, like the time for operations or the abstraction of a Turing machine.","According to the context, the role of a model of computation in algorithm analysis is to specify a computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. This allows for the measurement of the computational complexity of an algorithm given a specific model of computation.","Model of computation
. In the field of runtime analysis of algorithms, it is common to specify a computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. A commonly used example is the random-access machine, which has unit cost for read and write access to all of its memory cells. In this respect, it differs from the above-mentioned Turing machine model.

Model of computation
In computer science, and more specifically in computability theory and computational complexity theory, a model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input. A model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized. The computational complexity of an algorithm can be measured given a model of computation

Model of computation
.

What is the difference between empirical and theoretical analysis?,"Empirical analysis involves measuring the performance of an algorithm in real-world conditions, whereas theoretical analysis uses models and estimates to predict performance based on the input size, often expressed using Big O notation.","Based on the provided context, the difference between empirical and theoretical analysis can be inferred as follows:

Empirical approach refers to the method of analyzing algorithms or statistical methods by testing them through actual experiments, simulations, or implementations. This approach is limited by its reliance on specific platforms, programming languages, and operating systems.

Theoretical analysis, on the other hand, involves using logical arguments, mathematical proofs, and manipulations of probability distributions to derive results about statistical inference, algorithm performance, or computational complexity. Theoretical computer science, in particular, aims to understand the nature of computation and provide more efficient methodologies through abstract and mathematical concepts.

In summary, empirical analysis focuses on practical implementation and testing, whereas theoretical analysis relies on logical arguments, mathematical proofs, and abstract concepts to derive results about algorithms, statistics, or computation.","Statistics
. Theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference, as well as encompassing mathematical statistics. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments

Analysis of algorithms
. Since algorithms are platform-independent (i.e. a given algorithm can be implemented in an arbitrary programming language on an arbitrary computer running an arbitrary operating system), there are additional significant drawbacks to using an empirical approach to gauge the comparative performance of a given set of algorithms. Take as an example a program that looks up a specific entry in a sorted list of size n

Computer science
. Theoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies",0.7028358578681946,0.8239626288414001,yes,0.016471306158959375,0.20359281437125745,0.1437125748502994
How does binary search compare to linear search in terms of efficiency?,"Binary search is more efficient than linear search for large input sizes because it exhibits a logarithmic growth rate in execution time (O(log n)), whereas linear search exhibits a linear growth rate (O(n)).","According to the context, binary search has a logarithmic growth rate, whereas linear search has a linear growth rate. This means that as the input size increases, the run-time of binary search grows much more slowly than that of linear search. In fact, for large input sizes, the run-time of binary search will grow much faster than the input size itself (logarithmically), while the run-time of linear search will grow directly proportional to the input size (linearly). Therefore, in terms of efficiency, binary search is generally more efficient than linear search as the input size increases.","Analysis of algorithms
. Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A, a state-of-the-art machine, using a linear search algorithm, and on Computer B, a much slower machine, using a binary search algorithm. Benchmark testing on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following: Based on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that Computer A is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of Computer B

Analysis of algorithms
. However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error: Computer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a linear growth rate. The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size. Doubling the input size doubles the run-time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth. On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a logarithmic growth rate

How do you evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O?,"The time complexity can be evaluated by analyzing the algorithm's behavior, identifying the highest-order term, and expressing it in Big O notation to reflect how the execution time increases with input size.","To evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O, you would identify the dominant term in the expression that represents the time required to run the algorithm.

In this case, the algorithm takes additional steps after sorting, which has a known time complexity of O(n2). The number of additional steps is 55n3 + 2n + 10, but since Big O ignores lower-order terms and focuses on the growth rate as n grows arbitrarily large, we can ignore the constant terms (2n + 10) and focus on the dominant term, which is O(n3).

Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm using Big O notation would be O(n2 + n3), or simply O(n3), since the sorting step dominates the overall running time.","Algorithmic efficiency
. Big O notation is an asymptotic measure of function complexity, where f ( n ) = O ( g ( n ) ) {\textstyle f(n)=O{\bigl (}g(n){\bigr )}} roughly means the time requirement for an algorithm is proportional to g ( n ) {\displaystyle g(n)} , omitting lower-order terms that contribute less than g ( n ) {\displaystyle g(n)} to the growth of the function as n {\textstyle n} grows arbitrarily large

Big O notation
. Its developers are interested in finding a function T(n) that will express how long the algorithm will take to run (in some arbitrary measurement of time) in terms of the number of elements in the input set. The algorithm works by first calling a subroutine to sort the elements in the set and then perform its own operations. The sort has a known time complexity of O(n2), and after the subroutine runs the algorithm must take an additional 55n3 + 2n + 10 steps before it terminates

Algorithmic efficiency
. Less common measures of computational efficiency may also be relevant in some cases: Analysis of algorithms, typically using concepts like time complexity, can be used to get an estimate of the running time as a function of the size of the input data.

What does a run-time complexity of O(n^2) indicate?,"An algorithm with a run-time complexity of O(n^2) has a time complexity that grows quadratically as the input size increases, meaning the time taken for larger inputs increases rapidly.","A run-time complexity of O(n^2) indicates that there is a constant c_u such that the algorithm's running time will be less than c_u times n^2 as the input size (n) increases. In other words, the running time grows quadratically with the size of the input.","Computational complexity
. For example, the usual algorithm for integer multiplication has a complexity of O ( n 2 ) , {\displaystyle O(n^{2}),} this means that there is a constant c u {\displaystyle c_{u}} such that the multiplication of two integers of at most n digits may be done in a time less than c u n 2 . {\displaystyle c_{u}n^{2}

Analysis of algorithms
. For example, since the run-time of insertion sort grows quadratically as its input size increases, insertion sort can be said to be of order O(n2). Big O notation is a convenient way to express the worst-case scenario for a given algorithm, although it can also be used to express the average-case — for example, the worst-case scenario for quicksort is O(n2), but the average-case run-time is O(n log n)

Analysis of algorithms
. The run-time complexity for the worst-case scenario of a given algorithm can sometimes be evaluated by examining the structure of the algorithm and making some simplifying assumptions.

How does the run-time of algorithms affect system performance?,"Inefficient algorithms can slow down system performance, taking too long to execute or using excessive computational resources, rendering the system unresponsive or unable to meet time constraints.","The run-time of an algorithm affects system performance in that it determines how long a program takes to execute, which can vary significantly depending on the algorithm used. A program can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on the algorithm implemented. A slow-growing algorithm may initially seem faster, but as input size increases, it can be surpassed by a faster-growing algorithm, potentially affecting system performance.","Analysis of algorithms
. Run-time analysis is a theoretical classification that estimates and anticipates the increase in running time (or run-time or execution time) of an algorithm as its input size (usually denoted as n) increases. Run-time efficiency is a topic of great interest in computer science: A program can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on which algorithm it implements

Analysis of algorithms
. Quadrupling the input size only increases the run-time by a constant amount (in this example, 50,000 ns). Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it is running an algorithm with a much slower growth rate

Analysis of algorithms

What is the significance of lower bounds in algorithm analysis?,"Lower bounds in algorithm analysis set a theoretical minimum on the performance of an algorithm. However, they are often based on restrictive models of computation, which may not always reflect real-world performance.","The significance of lower bounds in algorithm analysis is that they make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem, including any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. In other words, a lower bound shows that no matter what algorithm is used to solve a problem, its time complexity cannot be less than a certain threshold T(n).","Analysis of algorithms
. A key point which is often overlooked is that published lower bounds for problems are often given for a model of computation that is more restricted than the set of operations that you could use in practice and therefore there are algorithms that are faster than what would naively be thought possible

Computational complexity theory
. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms. To show an upper bound T ( n ) {\displaystyle T(n)} on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T ( n ) {\displaystyle T(n)} . However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem

They are useful because they can improve performance, accuracy, and adaptability by overcoming the limitations of individual AI approaches. In the context of analysis of algorithms, hybrid algorithms like Timsort can take advantage of the strengths of different sorting algorithms (merge sort for large data and insertion sort for small data) to achieve better overall performance.","Analysis of algorithms

This is because the memory usage grows exponentially as the file size (input) increases.

In other words, if we represent the memory usage as 2^n, where n is the file size, then the time complexity of the algorithm would also grow exponentially with respect to the input size.","Computational complexity theory
. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001 n {\displaystyle 1.0001^{n}} operations is practical until n {\displaystyle n} gets relatively large. Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n 15 {\displaystyle n^{15}} , it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances

Computational complexity theory
. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem. To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} operations before halting

What is the role of transparency in applied research?,Transparency is crucial when adapting research protocols to ensure the integrity and reproducibility of results in applied research.,"According to the context, transparency plays a crucial role in applied science, as it helps eliminate bias, ensures careful experimental design, and facilitates peer review. Transparency also allows independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed and verify the results.","Applied science
. Thus, transparency in the methodology is crucial. Implications for the interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered. Moreover, this type of research method applies natural sciences to human conditions: Since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional conceptual framework, such as working hypotheses or pillar questions

Science
. Eliminating the bias can be achieved through transparency, careful experimental design, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results and conclusions. After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be

Array (data structure)
. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures. The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or ""abstract array"", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays

What is a linear array?,A linear array is a one-dimensional array where elements are stored sequentially in memory.,"According to the context, a linear array (also called a one-dimensional array) is the simplest type of data structure, where each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.","Array (data structure)
In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key, a collection of which may be a tuple, known as an index tuple. An array is stored such that the position (memory address) of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called a one-dimensional array

Array (data structure)
. The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array. In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a ""linear"" formula on the indices. A one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array

Array (data structure)
. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use. The term ""array"" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data",0.7549957633018494,0.8858295679092407,yes,0.029398036975048066,0.40816326530612246,0.36734693877551017
What is the base address of an array?,The base address is the memory address of the first element in an array.,"According to the context, the base address B is a fixed value that represents the starting address of the array. If the valid indices start at 0, then B is simply the address of the first element of the array. In general, the base address can be any arbitrary value chosen by the programmer or system, as long as it is used consistently to calculate the addresses of all elements in the array.","Array (data structure)
. However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address B. For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address B is replaced by B + 30c, then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35. If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant B may not be the address of any element

Array (data structure)
. For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c · i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride. If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element ""zeroth"" rather than ""first""

Array (data structure)
. For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i ",0.7432218790054321,0.9020234942436218,yes,0.059617745484519064,0.2758620689655173,0.2758620689655173
How are multidimensional arrays stored in memory?,"Multidimensional arrays are stored either in row-major or column-major order, depending on the programming language.","Based on the context, it is not explicitly stated how multidimensional arrays are stored in memory. However, it can be inferred that a multidimensional array would be stored as a linear array with each element of the inner arrays being adjacent to each other in memory.

For example, if you have a 2D array with two rows and three columns, it could be stored as:

element[0][0] at address X
element[0][1] at address X+4
element[0][2] at address X+8
element[1][0] at address X+12
element[1][1] at address X+16
element[1][2] at address X+20

This is known as column-major order.","Array (data structure)
. ""Column major order"" is analogous with respect to the first index. In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. This is known as spatial locality, which is a type of locality of reference. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order

In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key, a collection of which may be a tuple, known as an index tuple. An array is stored such that the position (memory address) of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called a one-dimensional array

Array (data structure)
. For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that t",0.6149787306785583,0.8374954462051392,yes,0.01880916804073644,0.1692307692307692,0.13846153846153844
What is the difference between row-major and column-major order?,"In row-major order, elements in each row are stored in consecutive memory positions, while in column-major order, elements in each column are stored consecutively.","According to the context, the difference between row-major and column-major order is:

* In row-major order, the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row.
* In column-major order, the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column.

In other words, row-major order stores rows contiguously in memory, while column-major order stores columns contiguously.","Array (data structure)
. For example, consider the matrix In the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row: In column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column: For arrays

Array (data structure)
. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array. For example, when computing the product A·B of two matrices, it would be best to have A stored in row-major order, and B in column-major order. Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed

What is the significance of array indexing starting from 0 in many programming languages?,"Zero-based indexing simplifies the implementation, where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of the array.","According to the context, the significance of array indexing starting from 0 in many programming languages (such as C, Java, and Lisp) is that it leads to a simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array.","Matrix (mathematics)
. Some programming languages start the numbering of array indexes at zero, in which case the entries of an m-by-n matrix are indexed by 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq i\leq m-1} and 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq j\leq n-1} . This article follows the more common convention in mathematical writing where enumeration starts from 1. The set of all m-by-n real matrices is often denoted M ( m , n ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}(m,n),} or M m × n ( R )

Array (data structure)
. An index maps the array value to a stored object. There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed: Using zero based indexing is the design choice of many influential programming languages, including C, Java and Lisp. This leads to simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero

Array (data structure)
. For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c · i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride.

What is a dynamic array?,"A dynamic array is an array that allows elements to be inserted or removed, with size that can grow or shrink.","According to the context, a dynamic array can be effectively implemented by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it. This allows for dynamic memory allocation, where elements can be added or removed from the end of the array without having to reallocate the entire array.","Array (data structure)
. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a dynamic version of an array; see dynamic array. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time. Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size

Array (data structure)
. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate ""dynamic memory"" portably. Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple IF statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose-built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array

What is a dope vector in relation to arrays?,"A dope vector is a record that contains information about an array's dimensions, base address, and element size, facilitating array operations.","A dope vector is a record that packs the parameters needed to fully define an array's addressing formula, including the dimension d, base address B, and increments c1, c2, ..., ck. It also typically includes information such as the size of each element and minimum/maximum values allowed for each index. The dope vector serves as a complete handle for the array, making it convenient to pass arrays as arguments to procedures.","Array (data structure)
. The addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension d, the base address B, and the increments c1, c2, ..., ck. It is often useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array's descriptor, stride vector, or dope vector. The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector. The dope vector is a complete handle for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to procedures

Array (data structure)
. Many useful array slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector. Often the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory. However, that is not necessary. Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them

Array (data structure)
. Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called ""matrices"". In some cases the term ""vector",0.732409656047821,0.9429198503494263,yes,0.09399164466566069,0.38297872340425526,0.3404255319148936
What is the concept of spatial locality in arrays?,"Spatial locality refers to the property that elements stored consecutively in memory allow faster scanning, enhancing iteration performance.","According to the context, spatial locality refers to the fact that scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory. This means that accessing elements in a contiguous block of memory (i.e., a ""hot zone"" in the cache) is more efficient than accessing scattered or non-contiguous elements.","Array (data structure)
. ""Column major order"" is analogous with respect to the first index. In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. This is known as spatial locality, which is a type of locality of reference. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order

Array (data structure)
. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does not mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time)

Algorithmic efficiency
. Nowadays the use of virtual memory appears to provide much more memory, but at the cost of performance. Much higher speed can be obtained if an algorithm and its data fit in cache memory; in this case minimizing space will also help minimize time. This is called the principle of locality, and can be subdivided into locality of reference, spatial locality, and temp",0.7433719038963318,0.9136123657226562,yes,0.05302455412691848,0.3513513513513514,0.2972972972972973
How does a dynamic array differ from a static array?,"A dynamic array allows resizing, while a static array has a fixed size once created.","According to the context, a dynamic array differs from a static array in that it has the ability to insert and delete elements, whereas a static array does not. Additionally, dynamic arrays reserve linear (Θ(n)) additional storage, whereas static arrays do not reserve any additional storage. Static arrays have a fixed maximum size or capacity, while dynamic arrays can be resized as needed.","Array (data structure)
. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form. Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism. Dynamic arrays or growable arrays are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear (Θ(n)) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage

Array (data structure)
. This effectively makes the array a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size or capacity; Pascal strings are examples of this. More complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional triangular array, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2. Both store and select take (deterministic worst case) constant time. Arrays take linear (O(n)) space in the number of elements n that they hold

In computer science, an associative array, key-value store, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. In mathematical terms, an associative array is a function with finite domain. It supports 'lookup', 'remove', and 'insert' operations. The dictionary problem is the classic problem of designing efficient data structures that implement associative arrays

Associative array
. In an associative array, the association between a key and a value is often known as a ""mapping""; the same word may also be used to refer to the process of creating a new association. The operations that are usually defined for an associative array are: Associative arrays may also include other operations such as determining the number of mappings or constructing an iterator to loop over all the mappings

. Arrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example, a two-dimensional array A with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression A in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and n for an n-dimensional array

The goal is for the agent to learn an optimal or near-optimal policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal over time.","Reinforcement learning
. Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision process: The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal (or near-optimal) policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from immediate rewards. This is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology

Reinforcement learning
. At each time step t, the agent receives the current state S t {\displaystyle S_{t}} and reward R t {\displaystyle R_{t}} . It then chooses an action A t {\displaystyle A_{t}} from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state S t + 1 {\displaystyle S_{t+1}} and the reward R t + 1 {\displaystyle R_{t+1}} associated with the transition ( S t , A t , S t + 1 ) {\displaystyle (S_{t},A_{t},S_{t+1})} is determined

This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another. As a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile time construct

Class (computer programming)
. An object expresses data type as an interface – the type of each member variable and the signature of each member function (method). A class defines an implementation of an interface, and instantiating the class results in an object that exposes the implementation via the interface. In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation‍—‌a concrete data structure and collection of subroutines‍—‌while a type is an interface

Class (computer programming)
. Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods—such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators—are created and called by compiler-generated code.

What is the purpose of inheritance in object-oriented programming?,"Inheritance allows a class to be based on another, inheriting its state and behavior with additional features.","According to the context, the purposes of inheritance in object-oriented programming are:

* To create classes that are built upon existing classes
* To specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface)
* To reuse code
* To independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces.","Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed acyclic graph. An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The following table shows which variables and functions get inherited dependent on the visibility given when deriving the class, using the terminology established by C++. Inheritance is used to co-relate two or more classes to each other. Many object-oriented programming languages permit a class or object to replace the implementation of an aspect—typically a behavior—that it has inherited. This process is called overriding

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining sim",0.6904602646827698,0.7813790440559387,yes,0.007851617416546584,0.18461538461538463,0.12307692307692308
What is instantiation in the context of object-oriented programming?,"Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class, allocating memory, and initializing its state.","In the context of object-oriented programming, instantiation refers to the process of creating a new object from a class. This involves allocating memory for the object's state and providing a reference to the consuming code. In other words, it is the creation of an instance of a class, which results in a unique object with its own set of attributes (data) and methods (actions).","Object-oriented programming
. Some classes are abstract, meaning they cannot be directly instantiated into objects; they're only meant to be inherited into other classes. Other classes are utility classes which contain only class variables and methods and are not meant to be instantiated or subclassed. In prototype-based programming, there aren't any classes. Instead, each object is linked to another object, called its prototype or parent

Class (computer programming)
. As an instance of a class, an object is constructed from a class via instantiation. Memory is allocated and initialized for the object state and a reference to the object is provided to consuming code. The object is usable until it is destroyed – its state memory is de-allocated. Most languages allow for custom logic at lifecycle events via a constructor and a destructor

Object-oriented programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects can contain data (called fields, attributes or properties) and have actions they can perform (called procedures or methods and implemented in code). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects tha",0.7670355439186096,0.9353078603744507,yes,0.06504743110116452,0.3855421686746988,0.3132530120481927
What is the difference between an abstract class and a concrete class?,"An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly, while a concrete class can be instantiated.","According to the context, an abstract class is a class that cannot be directly instantiated, whereas a concrete class is a class that can be directly instantiated. An abstract class can only be instantiated indirectly via a concrete subclass, while a concrete class can be created directly.","Class (computer programming)
. In a language that supports inheritance, an abstract class, or abstract base class (ABC), is a class that cannot be directly instantiated. By contrast, a concrete class is a class that can be directly instantiated. Instantiation of an abstract class can occur only indirectly, via a concrete subclass. An abstract class is either labeled as such explicitly or it may simply specify abstract methods (or virtual methods)

Class (computer programming)
. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system). For example, the type (interface) Stack might be implemented by SmallStack that is fast for small stacks but scales poorly and ScalableStack that scales well but has high overhead for small stacks. A class contains data field descriptions (or properties, fields, data members, or attributes)

Class (computer programming)
. Most object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated. For example, in Java, C# and PHP, the keyword abstract is used. In C++, an abstract class is a class having at least one abstract ",0.8516396880149841,0.8857132792472839,yes,0.14229481004215616,0.45901639344262296,0.42622950819672134
What is the role of an interface in object-oriented programming?,An interface defines the methods and attributes that a class must implement without specifying the implementation.,"According to the context, the interface of a class in object-oriented programming refers to the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit getter and setter methods). In other words, the interface represents the publicly accessible features of a class that can be used by external code.","Class (computer programming)
. In languages that support access specifiers, the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit getter and setter methods); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external code and thus are not part of the interface. Object-oriented programming methodology dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other

Object-oriented programming
. Encapsulation also helps keep related code together (decoupling), making it easier for programmers to understand. In object-oriented programming, objects act as a barrier between their internal workings and external code. Outside code can only interact with an object by calling specific public methods or variables. If a class only allows access to its data through methods and not directly, this is called information hiding

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The superclass establishes a common interface and foundational functionality, which specialized subclasses can inherit, modify, and supplement. The software inherited by a subclass is",0.7277930974960327,0.785815954208374,yes,0.035143232233380985,0.2571428571428572,0.19999999999999998
What is the significance of access specifiers in a class?,"Access specifiers control the visibility and accessibility of a class's members, such as methods and attributes.","According to the context, the significance of access specifiers in a class is to:

* Enforce class invariants (constraints on the state of objects)
* Separate internal data from the interface: make private the internal structure and use public accessor methods to inspect or alter it
* Define the interface of a class, which includes public members (methods and attributes), and not intend for external code to depend on private members or internal data structures.","Class (computer programming)
. Object-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants—constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public accessor methods can be used to inspect or alter such private data

Class (computer programming)
. Access specifiers do not necessarily control visibility, in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at runtime (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from the client code will be prevented by the type checker

What is composition in object-oriented programming?,"Composition is when a class is composed of other classes, establishing a ""has-a"" relationship between them.","Composition in object-oriented programming refers to a situation where one object contains another object (or objects of one class contain objects of another class). This type of structure shows ""has-a"" relationships, such as ""an employee has an address"". For example, an Employee object might have an Address object inside it, along with other information like ""first_name"" and ""position"".","Object-oriented programming
. Objects are usually stored in memory, and in many programming languages, they work like pointers that link directly to a contiguous block containing the object instances's data. Objects can contain other objects. This is called object composition. For example, an Employee object might have an Address object inside it, along with other information like ""first_name"" and ""position"". This type of structures shows ""has-a"" relationships, like ""an employee has an address""

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. Inheritance is contrasted with object composition, where one object contains another object (or objects of one class contain objects of another class); see composition over inheritance. In contrast to subtyping’s is-a relationship, composition implements a has-a relationship. Mathematically speaking, inheritance in any system of classes induces a strict partial order on the set of classes in that system

What is multiple inheritance and how is it handled in modern languages?,"Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one class, but many languages (e.g., Java) only allow single inheritance.","Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from more than one superclass or parent class. In modern languages, such as Smalltalk and Java, this feature can be useful for modeling but not necessarily for implementation at runtime. Some languages, like Python, also support multiple inheritance.","Class (computer programming)
. If used carelessly this feature can introduce some of the same system complexity and ambiguity classes were designed to avoid. Most modern object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk and Java require single inheritance at run time. For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation. However, semantic web application objects do have multiple superclasses

Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
. The idea then spread to Smalltalk, C++, Java, Python, and many other languages. There are various types of inheritance, based on paradigm and specific language. ""Multiple inheritance ... was widely supposed to be very difficult to implement efficiently. For example, in a summary of C++ in his book on Objective C, Brad Cox actually claimed that adding multiple inheritance to C++ was impossible. Thus, multiple inheritance seemed more of a challenge

What is a sealed class?,"A sealed class cannot be subclassed, ensuring that it cannot be extended or modified.","A sealed class is a class that cannot be subclassed. It is implicitly concrete, meaning it can be instantiated and used directly, unlike abstract classes which must be derived to be used. In other words, a sealed class cannot be inherited from or extended by another class.","Class (computer programming)
. A sealed class is implicitly concrete. A class declared as sealed via the keyword sealed in C# or final in Java or PHP. For example, Java's String class is marked as final. Sealed classes may allow a compiler to perform optimizations that are not available for classes that can be subclassed. An open class can be changed. Typically, an executable program cannot be changed by customers. Developers can often change some classes, but typically cannot change standard or built-in ones

Class (computer programming)
. In some languages, such as Python, Ruby or Smalltalk, a class is also an object; thus each class is an instance of a unique metaclass that is built into the language. The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) provides metaobject protocols (MOPs) to implement those classes and metaclasses. A sealed class cannot be subclassed. It is basically the opposite of an abstract class, which must be derived to be used. A sealed class is implicitly concrete

. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationship among electrical activity of the neurons in the ensemble.

2. Error correction
3. Line encoding (unipolar, polar, bipolar, and Manchester encoding)
4. Coding theory that helps synchronization","Coding theory
. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data. There are four types of coding: Data compression attempts to remove unwanted redundancy from the data from a source in order to transmit it more efficiently. For example, DEFLATE data compression makes files smaller, for purposes such as to reduce Internet traffic. Data compression and error correction may be studied in combination

Coding theory
. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar, and Manchester encoding. Another concern of coding theory is designing codes that help synchronization. A code may be designed so that a phase shift can be easily detected and corrected and that multiple signals can be sent on the same channel. Another application of codes, used in some mobile phone systems, is code-division multiple access (CDMA)

How does error correction improve data transmission?,Error correction adds redundancy to data to make it more robust against disturbances in transmission.,"According to the context, error correction improves data transmission by enabling the reconstruction of the original, error-free data in many cases. This is done by detecting errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission and then correcting them to ensure reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels.","Error detection and correction
. Error detection techniques allow detecting such errors, while error correction enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases. Error detection is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver. Error correction is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original, error-free data

Error detection and correction
. In a systematic scheme, the transmitter sends the original (error-free) data and attaches a fixed number of check bits (or parity data), which are derived from the data bits by some encoding algorithm. If error detection is required, a receiver can simply apply the same algorithm to the received data bits and compare its output with the received check bits; if the values do not match, an error has occurred at some point during the transmission

What is the concept of entropy in source coding?,Entropy measures the uncertainty in a message and helps minimize redundancy in source coding.,"The concept of entropy in source coding refers to the measure of information or uncertainty in a source. It represents the minimum number of bits required to encode a message, and it serves as a fundamental limit on how well a source can be compressed. In other words, entropy is the lowest possible bitrate that can be achieved by any compression scheme for a given source.","Coding theory
. The code word of the empty string is the empty string itself: Entropy of a source is the measure of information. Basically, source codes try to reduce the redundancy present in the source, and represent the source with fewer bits that carry more information. Data compression which explicitly tries to minimize the average length of messages according to a particular assumed probability model is called entropy encoding

Coding theory
. Various techniques used by source coding schemes try to achieve the limit of entropy of the source. C(x) ≥ H(x), where H(x) is entropy of source (bitrate), and C(x) is the bitrate after compression. In particular, no source coding scheme can be better than the entropy of the source. Facsimile transmission uses a simple run length code. Source coding removes all data superfluous to the need of the transmitter, decreasing the bandwidth required for transmission

They are applied to source bits in blocks, hence the name ""linear block codes"".","Coding theory
. There are block codes that are not linear, but it is difficult to prove that a code is a good one without this property. Linear block codes are summarized by their symbol alphabets (e.g., binary or ternary) and parameters (n,m,dmin) where There are many types of linear block codes, such as Block codes are tied to the sphere packing problem, which has received some attention over the years. In two dimensions, it is easy to visualize

Coding theory
. The term algebraic coding theory denotes the sub-field of coding theory where the properties of codes are expressed in algebraic terms and then further researched. Algebraic coding theory is basically divided into two major types of codes: It analyzes the following three properties of a code – mainly: Linear block codes have the property of linearity, i.e. the sum of any two codewords is also a code word, and they are applied to the source bits in blocks, hence the name linear block codes

How does convolutional coding differ from block coding?,"Convolutional coding processes input bits through a system with memory, providing greater implementation simplicity.","According to the context, convolutional codes do not offer more protection against noise than an equivalent block code. However, they may offer greater simplicity of implementation over a block code of equal power. This is because the encoder is usually a simple circuit with state memory and feedback logic, whereas block codes require a different approach to encoding.","Coding theory
. So we generally find the output of the system convolutional encoder, which is the convolution of the input bit, against the states of the convolution encoder, registers. Fundamentally, convolutional codes do not offer more protection against noise than an equivalent block code. In many cases, they generally offer greater simplicity of implementation over a block code of equal power. The encoder is usually a simple circuit which has state memory and some feedback logic, normally XOR gates

Error detection and correction
. Error-correcting codes are usually distinguished between convolutional codes and block codes: Shannon's theorem is an important theorem in forward error correction, and describes the maximum information rate at which reliable communication is possible over a channel that has a certain error probability or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This strict upper limit is expressed in terms of the channel capacity

Machine learning
. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for ""general intelligence""

What is line coding used for?,"Line coding represents digital signals for transmission, optimizing the signal for the physical channel.",Line coding is often used for digital data transport.,"Coding theory
. Line coding is often used for digital data transport. It consists of representing the digital signal to be transported by an amplitude- and time-discrete signal that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital data on a transmission link is called line encoding

What is the role of ARQ codes in data transmission?,"ARQ codes add redundancy for error checking, prompting the sender to retransmit data if errors are detected.","According to the context, the role of ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) codes in data transmission is to add redundancy to each message for error checking, making it possible to detect and correct errors. If the check bits are not consistent with the rest of the message when it arrives, the receiver will ask the sender to retransmit the message.","Error detection and correction
. There are three major types of error correction: Automatic repeat request (ARQ) is an error control method for data transmission that makes use of error-detection codes, acknowledgment and/or negative acknowledgment messages, and timeouts to achieve reliable data transmission. An acknowledgment is a message sent by the receiver to indicate that it has correctly received a data frame. Usually, when the transmitter does not receive the acknowledgment before the timeout occurs (i.e

. To the receiver, the signals of other users will appear to the demodulator only as a low-level noise. Another general class of codes are the automatic repeat-request (ARQ) codes. In these codes the sender adds redundancy to each message for error checking, usually by adding check bits. If the check bits are not consistent with the rest of the message when it arrives, the receiver will ask the sender to retransmit the message. All but the simplest wide area network protocols use ARQ

A number of formalisms for modeling and understanding concurrent systems have been developed, including: Some of these models of concurrency are primarily intended to support reasoning and specification, while others can be used through the entire development cycle, including design, implementation, proof, testing and simulation of concurrent systems. Some of these are based on message passing, while others have different mechanisms for concurrency

Concurrency (computer science)
. Concurrency improves responsiveness, throughput, and scalability in modern computing, including: Concurrency is a broader concept that encompasses several related ideas, including: Because computations in a concurrent system can interact with each other while being executed, the number of possible execution paths in the system can be extremely large, and the resulting outcome can be indeterminate

Some concurrent programming models include coprocesses and deterministic concurrency. In these models, threads of control explicitly yield their timeslices, either to the system or to another process.

Computational complexity theory
. Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem

. A closed-loop controller uses feedback to control states or outputs of a dynamical system. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., voltage applied to an electric motor) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with sensors and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is ""fed back"" as input to the process, closing the loop

Control theory
. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems

. To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point

Network performance
. In digital transmission, the number of bit errors is the number of received bits of a data stream over a communication channel that have been altered due to noise, interference, distortion or bit synchronization errors. The bit error rate or bit error ratio (BER) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. BER is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a percentage

* Settling time

These specifications are typically used to meet the requirements of the step response.","Control theory
. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are PID controllers. A less common implementation may include either or both a Lead or Lag filter.

In other words, it is a method for determining whether a system will remain stable and not diverge over time. Specifically, Lyapunov stability criteria are used to determine the stability of a system without considering its internal dynamics.","Control theory
. Being fairly new, modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored. Scholars like Rudolf E. Kálmán and Aleksandr Lyapunov are well known among the people who have shaped modern control theory. The stability of a general dynamical system with no input can be described with Lyapunov stability criteria. For simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems

Control theory
. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks. Every control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For linear systems, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Nonlinear control systems use specific theories (normally based on Aleksandr Lyapunov's Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system

. Mathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the poles of its transfer function must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero. Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside The difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions

Reinforcement learning
. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed). The search for this balance is known as the exploration–exploitation dilemma

1. Exploitation: Take the action that maximizes the expected cumulative reward (i.e., the optimal action).
2. Exploration: Choose an action randomly with probability ε, and take the optimal action with probability 1 - ε.

In other words, the agent follows a policy that is a mix of exploiting what it knows about the environment and exploring new possibilities to learn more about the environment. The parameter ε controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.","Reinforcement learning

Robotics
. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure. At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a ""cognitive"" model

"What is a ""balancing robot""?","A balancing robot uses sensors like gyroscopes to detect falls and adjust its movements, often seen in one-wheeled robots or systems like the Segway.","A ""balancing robot"" is a type of robot that uses a gyroscope to detect its tilt and adjust the wheel(s) proportionally in the same direction to counterbalance its fall, allowing it to balance itself.","Robotics
. Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as Carnegie Mellon University's ""Ballbot"" which is the approximate height and width of a person, and Tohoku Gakuin University's ""BallIP"". Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people

Robotics
. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to. Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum. Many different balancing robots have been designed

Robotics
. While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform).

However, it does not enable walking over rocky or uneven terrain.","Robotics
. For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page. A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability. This technique was recently demonstrated by Anybots' Dexter Robot, which is so stable, it can even jump. Another example is the TU Delft Flame

They are often referred to as the functional end of a robot arm and can be replaced with different types to achieve various small ranges of tasks.","Robotics
. Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, move or otherwise have an effect. Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as end effectors, while the ""arm"" is referred to as a manipulator. Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks

Robotics
. Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception. As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error

It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll

For cases where this possibility is unsuitable or would make sense to be rejected, the term proper subset is defined, variously denoted A ⊂ B {\displaystyle A\subset B} , A ⊊ B {\displaystyle A\subsetneq B} , or A ⫋ B {\displaystyle A\subsetneqq B} (note however that the notation A ⊂ B {\displaystyle A\subset B} is sometimes used synonymously with A ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} ; that is, allowing the possibility that A and B are equal)

Set theory
. We call A a proper subset of B if and only if A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B. Also, 1, 2, and 3 are members (elements) of the set {1, 2, 3}, but are not subsets of it; and in turn, the subsets, such as {1}, are not members of the set {1, 2, 3}. More complicated relations can exist; for example, the set {1} is both a member and a proper subset of the set {1, {1}}. Just as arithmetic features binary operations on numbers, set theory features binary operations on sets

The empty set is also occasionally called the null set, though this name is ambiguous and can lead to several interpretations. The empty set can be denoted with empty braces "" { } {\displaystyle \{\}} "" or the symbol "" ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } "" or "" ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } ""

Boolean algebra
. Example 2. The empty set and X. This two-element algebra shows that a concrete Boolean algebra can be finite even when it consists of subsets of an infinite set. It can be seen that every field of subsets of X must contain the empty set and X. Hence no smaller example is possible, other than the degenerate algebra obtained by taking X to be empty so as to make the empty set and X coincide. Example 3

. Very soon thereafter, Bertrand Russell discovered Russell's paradox in 1901, and Jules Richard discovered Richard's paradox. Zermelo provided the first set of axioms for set theory. These axioms, together with the additional axiom of replacement proposed by Abraham Fraenkel, are now called Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). Zermelo's axioms incorporated the principle of limitation of size to avoid Russell's paradox

This allows values to fall between the traditional binary classification of entirely within or out.","Soft computing
. Unlike classical sets that allow members to be entirely within or out, fuzzy sets allow partial membership by incorporating ""graduation"" between sets. Fuzzy logic operations include negation, conjunction, and disjunction, which handle membership between data sets. Fuzzy rules are logical statements that map the correlation between input and output parameters. They set the rules needed to trace variable relationships linguistically, and they would not be possible without linguistic variables

Set theory
. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include rough set theory and fuzzy set theory, in which the value of an atomic formula embodying the membership relation is not simply True or False. The Boolean-valued models of ZFC are a related subject. An enrichment of ZFC called internal set theory was proposed by Edward Nelson in 1977.

How does social computing support human interactions?,"It makes socially produced information available to users, influencing decision-making and behavior through systems like reviews and recommendations.","According to the context, social computing supports human interactions by recognizing that humans are profoundly social from birth. It acknowledges that people develop abilities for interacting with each other through expression, gesture, spoken and written language, and that this leads to a remarkable sensitivity to the behavior of those around them. In essence, social computing takes into account the social context in which human decisions are made, allowing for more informed interactions between humans and technology.","Social computing
. Social computing begins with the observation that humans—and human behavior—are profoundly social. From birth, humans orient to one another, and as they grow, they develop abilities for interacting with each other. This ranges from expression and gesture to spoken and written language. As a consequence, people are remarkably sensitive to the behavior of those around them and make countless decisions that are shaped by their social context

Human–computer interaction
. In recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis, as there are a lot of social computing technologies that include blogs, emails, social networking, quick messaging, and various others. Much of this research draws from psychology, social psychology, and sociology. For example, one study found out that people expected a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a woman's name

In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another

Object-oriented programming
. Bertrand Meyer produced the first design of the Eiffel language in 1985, which focused on software quality using a design by contract approach. In the 1990s, object-oriented programming became the main way of programming, especially as more languages supported it. These included Visual FoxPro 3.0, C++, and Delphi. OOP became even more popular with the rise of graphical user interfaces, which used objects for buttons, menus and other elements

Object-oriented programming
. This makes programs easier to manage. Each modules has its own namespace, so items in one module will not conflict with items in another. Object-oriented programming (OOP) was created to make code easier to reuse and maintain.

Testing during this phase is generally performed by the programmer and with the purpose to verify that the code behaves as designed and to know when the code is ready for the next level of testing

Software testing
. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk

. Agile software development commonly involves testing while the code is being written and organizing teams with both programmers and testers and with team members performing both programming and testing. One agile practice, test-driven software development (TDD), is a way of unit testing such that unit-level testing is performed while writing the product code. Test code is updated as new features are added and failure conditions are discovered (bugs fixed)

Software development
. Quality testing also often includes stress and load checking (whether the software is robust to heavy levels of input or usage), integration testing (to ensure that the software is adequately integrated with other software), and compatibility testing (measuring the software's performance across different operating systems or browsers). When tests are written before the code, this is called test-driven development. Production is the phase in which software is deployed to the end user

Software development
. Code reviews by other developers are often used to scrutinize new code added to the project, and according to some estimates dramatically reduce the number of bugs persisting after testing is complete.

. Historically, the structure, classification, and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the ISO 9126 and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000 standard. Based on these models (see Models), the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) has defined five major desirable structural characteristics needed for a piece of software to provide business value: Reliability, Efficiency, Security, Maintainability, and (adequate) Size

Software quality
. The main focus is on internal structural quality. Subcategories have been created to handle specific areas like business application architecture and technical characteristics such as data access and manipulation or the notion of transactions

Software quality
. Tom DeMarco has proposed that ""a product's quality is a function of how much it changes the world for the better."" This can be interpreted as meaning that functional quality and user satisfaction are more important than structural quality in determining software quality.

. More precisely, using the Quality Function Deployment approach, these measurable attributes are the ""hows"" that need to be enforced to enable the ""whats"" in the Software Quality definition above. The structure, classification and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the ISO 9126-3 and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000:2005 quality model. The main focus is on internal structural quality

Information security
. Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment. Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. ISO/IEC 27001 has defined controls in different areas. Organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization. ISO/IEC 27002 offers a guideline for organizational information security standards

Software quality also plays a role in the release phase of a software project. Specifically, the quality and establishment of the release processes (also patch processes), configuration management are important parts of an overall software engineering process

Software quality
. Structural quality analysis and measurement is performed through the analysis of the source code, the architecture, software framework, database schema in relationship to principles and standards that together define the conceptual and logical architecture of a system. This is distinct from the basic, local, component-level code analysis typically performed by development tools which are mostly concerned with implementation considerations and are crucial during debugging and testing activities

Software quality
In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions: Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only statically through the analysis of the software's inner structure, its source code (see Software metrics), at the unit level, and at the system level (sometimes referred to as end-to-end testing), which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by Object",0.7546881437301636,0.793280839920044,yes,0.0401485419351806,0.4,0.3666666666666667
What is the relationship between quality and customer satisfaction?,"Quality is determined by how well the software meets customer needs and provides satisfaction, based on their actual experience with the product.","According to the context, quality is a customer determination, not an engineer's, marketing's, or general management's determination. It is based on the customer's actual experience with the product or service, measured against their requirements, which represents a moving target in a competitive market. Additionally, it states that one of the dominant meanings of the word quality is ""product satisfaction"", implying that quality and customer satisfaction are closely related. Therefore, the relationship between quality and customer satisfaction is that quality is determined by customer satisfaction.","Software quality
. Quality is a customer determination, not an engineer's determination, not a marketing determination, nor a general management determination. It is based on the customer's actual experience with the product or service, measured against his or her requirements -- stated or unstated, conscious or merely sensed, technically operational or entirely subjective -- and always representing a moving target in a competitive market. The word quality has multiple meanings

Software quality
. The word quality has multiple meanings. Two of these meanings dominate the use of the word: 1. Quality consists of those product features which meet the need of customers and thereby provide product satisfaction. 2. Quality consists of freedom from deficiencies.

Do symbolic computation engines recognize special functions?,"Yes, most symbolic engines recognize a majority of special functions.","Based on the context, it can be inferred that special functions are not necessarily recognized or handled differently by symbolic computation engines such as Macsyma and Maple. The focus of these engines seems to be on manipulating expressions and performing computations using various techniques (such as sorting operands in Macsyma) rather than specifically recognizing or handling ""special"" functions.

In fact, the text does not mention special functions being handled differently by these engines at all. Therefore, the answer would be:

No, symbolic computation engines do not recognize special functions.","Special functions
. Before electronic computation, the importance of a special function was affirmed by the laborious computation of extended tables of values for ready look-up, as for the familiar logarithm tables. (Babbage's difference engine was an attempt to compute such tables.) For this purpose, the main techniques are: More theoretical questions include: asymptotic analysis; analytic continuation and monodromy in the complex plane; and symmetry principles and other structural equations

Functional programming
. Some special purpose languages such as Coq allow only well-founded recursion and are strongly normalizing (nonterminating computations can be expressed only with infinite streams of values called codata). As a consequence, these languages fail to be Turing complete and expressing certain functions in them is impossible, but they can still express a wide class of interesting computations while avoiding the problems introduced by unrestricted recursion

Computer algebra

. These encodings also were not ""self-synchronizing"", so that locating character boundaries required backing up to the start of a string, and pasting two strings together could result in corruption of the second string. Unicode has simplified the picture somewhat. Most programming languages now have a datatype for Unicode strings. Unicode's preferred byte stream format UTF-8 is designed not to have the problems described above for older multibyte encodings

. Modern implementations often use the extensive repertoire defined by Unicode along with a variety of complex encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16. The term byte string usually indicates a general-purpose string of bytes, rather than strings of only (readable) characters, strings of bits, or such. Byte strings often imply that bytes can take any value and any data can be stored as-is, meaning that there should be no value interpreted as a termination value

What is the role of character encoding in strings?,It defines how characters are mapped to bytes in memory.,"According to the context, character encoding plays a crucial role in strings. It determines how many bytes are required to store a single logical character in the string. For example, UTF-8 can take anywhere from one to four bytes to represent a single code point, while some encodings like EUC guarantee that ASCII characters will always be represented by a single byte. This means that different character encodings can affect how strings are stored and processed in a computer program.","String (computer science)
. See also ""Null-terminated"" below. String datatypes have historically allocated one byte per character, and, although the exact character set varied by region, character encodings were similar enough that programmers could often get away with ignoring this, since characters a program treated specially (such as period and space and comma) were in the same place in all the encodings a program would encounter. These character sets were typically based on ASCII or EBCDIC

String (computer science)
. Most string implementations are very similar to variable-length arrays with the entries storing the character codes of corresponding characters. The principal difference is that, with certain encodings, a single logical character may take up more than one entry in the array. This happens for example with UTF-8, where single codes (UCS code points) can take anywhere from one to four bytes, and single characters can take an arbitrary number of codes

What is the bias-variance tradeoff?,"It's the balance between a model’s simplicity (bias) and flexibility (variance), affecting prediction accuracy.","According to the context, the bias-variance tradeoff is a tradeoff between:

* Bias: A learning algorithm with low bias must be ""flexible"" so that it can fit the data well.
* Variance: If the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance.

In other words, there is a tradeoff between an algorithm's ability to accurately represent the underlying pattern in the data (bias) and its tendency to overfit or underfit the data (variance).","Supervised learning
. Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. A learning algorithm with low bias must be ""flexible"" so that it can fit the data well. But if the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance. A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a bias/variance parameter that the user can adjust)

* Tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias when dealing with input data of large dimensions.","Data science
. Machine learning models can amplify existing biases present in training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes.

Supervised learning
. If the input feature vectors have large dimensions, learning the function can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features.

Mathematical model
. For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model

How does training data size affect model selection?,"More complex models need more data to generalize well, while simpler models can work with less data.","According to the context, if the size of the training data set is small, it will generally result in a large difference between how well the model fits the validation data and the training data. This suggests that as the size of the training data decreases, the accuracy of the model on new data (validation data) will also decrease significantly.","Cross-validation (statistics)
. If an independent sample of validation data is taken from the same population as the training data, it will generally turn out that the model does not fit the validation data as well as it fits the training data. The size of this difference is likely to be large especially when the size of the training data set is small, or when the number of parameters in the model is large. Cross-validation is a way to estimate the size of this effect

Machine learning
. Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be

A third issue is the dimensionality of the input space

1. Manually removing irrelevant features from the input data.
2. Using feature selection algorithms to identify and discard irrelevant features.

. A rooted phylogenetic tree (see two graphics at top) is a directed tree with a unique node — the root — corresponding to the (usually imputed) most recent common ancestor of all the entities at the leaves of the tree. The root node does not have a parent node, but serves as the parent of all other nodes in the tree. The root is therefore a node of degree 2, while other internal nodes have a minimum degree of 3 (where ""degree"" here refers to the total number of incoming and outgoing edges)

. These constraints mean there are no cycles or ""loops"" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal.

In simpler terms, HTML is a markup language used to create web pages!","World Wide Web
. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements

. A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software user agent for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's server and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format, and display a web page on the user's computer

World Wide Web
. In addition to allowing users to find, display, and move between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below), and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into websites. The most popular browsers are Chrome, Safari, Edge, Samsung Internet and Firefox. A Web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests

What is the HTTP request process when accessing a web page?,"The browser sends an HTTP request to a web server, which returns an HTTP response with the requested content.","According to the context, the HTTP request process when accessing a web page involves:

1. The browser sends an HTTP request to the computer at the specified IP address (e.g., 0.113.4 or 2001:db8:2e::7334).
2. The request is sent across the Internet to the remote web server.
3. The web server delivers the request to web server software listening for requests on port 80 (or port 443 for HTTPS).

HTTP normally uses port number 80 and for HTTPS it normally uses port number 443

World Wide Web
. On a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet.

How do search engines gather information?,"Search engines use algorithms to crawl the web, indexing information and displaying results in a search engine results page (SERP).","According to the context, search engines gather information by running an algorithm on a web crawler to maintain real-time information and mine data available in databases or open directories.","Information retrieval
. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications. An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance

World Wide Web
. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler. Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the deep web. In 1990, Archie, the world’s first search engine, was released

How can web browsing activity be hidden?,Web browsing activity can be hidden using private browsing modes or by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt traffic and mask the IP address.,"Web browsing activity can be hidden by:

* Using a virtual private network (VPN)
* Using a browser's private browsing mode (also known as Incognito mode)

Additionally, Google Project Zero researcher Jann Horn recommends using private browsing mode when connected to public Wi-Fi hotspots or other untrusted networks.","World Wide Web
. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after channel surfing), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers

World Wide Web
. Web servers usually log IP addresses in a log file. Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable history feature, and usually cache much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems.

Nested virtualization becomes more necessary as widespread operating systems gain built-in hypervisor functionality, which in a virtualized environment can be used only if the surrounding hypervisor supports nested virtualization; for example, Windows 7 is capable of running Windows XP applications inside a built-in virtual machine

Virtual machine
. Furthermore, moving already existing virtualized environments into a cloud, following the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach, is much more complicated if the destination IaaS platform does not support nested virtualization.

How does hardware-assisted virtualization differ from software virtualization?,"Hardware-assisted virtualization uses hardware support to facilitate VM monitoring and guest isolation, while software virtualization relies on the host software.","According to the context, hardware-assisted virtualization provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation. This is different from software virtualization, which employs various techniques to enable nested virtualization if the architecture does not provide required hardware support. In other words, hardware-assisted virtualization leverages specific hardware features to improve virtualization performance and capabilities, whereas software virtualization relies on software solutions to achieve similar results.","Virtual machine
. In hardware-assisted virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation. Hardware-assisted virtualization was first introduced on the IBM System/370 in 1972, for use with VM/370, the first virtual machine operating system offered by IBM as an official product. In 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD provided additional hardware to support virtualization

Virtual machine
. If a particular architecture does not provide hardware support required for nested virtualization, various software techniques are employed to enable it. Over time, more architectures gain required hardware support; for example, since the Haswell microarchitecture (announced in 2013), Intel started to include VMCS shadowing as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization.

What is the purpose of snapshots in virtual machines?,"Snapshots provide a backup technique to restore the VM's state to a previous point, enabling recovery from risky operations.","The purpose of snapshots in virtual machines is to enable the restoration of the virtual machine's state at an exact point in time, effectively undoing any changes that occurred afterwards. This allows for a way to revert back to a previous state or configuration, and can be used as a kind of ""undo"" feature for virtual machines.","Virtual machine
. The pioneer implementation was FreeBSD jails; other examples include Docker, Solaris Containers, OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, LXC, AIX Workload Partitions, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers, and iCore Virtual Accounts. A snapshot is a state of a virtual machine, and generally its storage devices, at an exact point in time. A snapshot enables the virtual machine's state at the time of the snapshot to be restored later, effectively undoing any changes that occurred afterwards

Virtual machine
. Thus, the entire stack of snapshots is virtually a single coherent disk; in that sense, creating snapshots works similarly to the incremental backup technique. Other components of a virtual machine can also be included in a snapshot, such as the contents of its random-access memory (RAM), BIOS settings, or its configuration settings. ""Save state"" feature in video game console emulators is an example of such snapshots

Virtual machine
. Restoring a snapshot consists of discarding or disregarding all overlay layers that are added after that snapshot, and directing all new changes to a new overlay.

What is the significance of JIT (just-in-time) compilation in process VMs?,"JIT compilation improves performance by compiling bytecode into machine code at runtime, allowing it to run more efficiently.","The significance of JIT (just-in-time) compilation in process VMs is that it allows for performance comparable to compiled programming languages, making it a popular approach with the Java programming language and other virtual machines.","Virtual machine
. Significant advances occurred in the implementation of Smalltalk-80, particularly the Deutsch/Schiffmann implementation which pushed just-in-time (JIT) compilation forward as an implementation approach that uses process virtual machine. Later notable Smalltalk VMs were VisualWorks, the Squeak Virtual Machine, and Strongtalk

Interpreter (computing)
. However, for interpreters, an AST causes more overhead than a bytecode interpreter, because of nodes related to syntax performing no useful work, of a less sequential representation (requiring traversal of more pointers) and of overhead visiting the tree. Further blurring the distinction between interpreters, bytecode interpreters and compilation is just-in-time (JIT) compilation, a technique in which the intermediate representation is compiled to native machine code at runtime

Virtual machine
. Process VMs are implemented using an interpreter; performance comparable to compiled programming languages can be achieved by the use of just-in-time compilation. This type of VM has become popular with the Java programming language, which is implemented using the Java virtual machine.

In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two

Computer hardware
. Virtual hardware is software that mimics the function of hardware; it is commonly used in infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and platform as a Service (PaaS). Embedded systems have the most variation in their processing power and cost: from an 8-bit processor that could cost less than USD$0.10, to higher-end processors capable of billions of operations per second and costing over USD$100",0.740015983581543,0.8331790566444397,yes,0.015468430022876805,0.30952380952380953,0.16666666666666666
What are the advantages of using VMs for server consolidation?,"VMs allow multiple servers to run on the same physical hardware, improving resource utilization and reducing costs.","According to the context, multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) running their own guest operating system are frequently engaged for server consolidation. This means that using VMs for server consolidation provides the advantage of being able to deploy more services on the same physical machine, thus reducing the amount of hardware needed.","Virtual machine
. Virtual machines have other advantages for operating system development and may include improved debugging access and faster reboots. Multiple VMs running their own guest operating system are frequently engaged for server consolidation. A process virtual machine, sometimes called an application virtual machine, or Managed Runtime Environment (MRE), runs as a normal application inside a host OS and supports a single process. It is created when that process is started and destroyed when it exits

Green computing
. New virtual technologies, such as operating-system-level virtualization can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a more efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in virtual machines, so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. Terminal servers have also been used in green computing

What is the purpose of virtual disks in VM environments?,"Virtual disks simulate storage devices within the VM, enabling data access and manipulation within the virtualized environment.","Based on the context, the purpose of virtual disks in VM environments is to simulate disk storage for the virtual machine, allowing any requests by the VM for a location on its physical disk to be transparently translated into an operation on the corresponding file. This provides a backup technique and allows for flexibility and portability in VM operations.","Virtual machine
. This capability is useful as a backup technique, for example, prior to performing a risky operation. Virtual machines frequently use virtual disks for their storage; in a very simple example, a 10-gigabyte hard disk drive is simulated with a 10-gigabyte flat file. Any requests by the VM for a location on its physical disk are transparently translated into an operation on the corresponding file

Virtual machine
. Its purpose is to provide a platform-independent programming environment that abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or operating system and allows a program to execute in the same way on any platform. A process VM provides a high-level abstraction – that of a high-level programming language (compared to the low-level ISA abstraction of the system VM)

. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, word processing began to slowly shift from glorified typewriters augmented with electronic features to become fully computer-based (although only with single-purpose hardware) with the development of several innovations. Just before the arrival of the personal computer (PC), IBM developed the floppy disk. In the 1970s, the first proper word-processing systems appeared, which allowed display and editing of documents on CRT screens

What was WordStar?,WordStar was a word processing program released in 1978 that became dominant in the market due to its many new features.,"According to the context, WordStar was a popular word processing program written for the early CP/M (Control Program–Micro) operating system, later ported to CP/M-86, then to MS-DOS. It dominated the market until 1985 when WordPerfect sales exceeded its sales.","Word processor
. WordStar was written for the early CP/M (Control Program–Micro) operating system, ported to CP/M-86, then to MS-DOS, and was the most popular word processing program until 1985 when WordPerfect sales first exceeded WordStar sales. Early word processing software was not as intuitive as word processor devices. Most early word processing software required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys such as ""copy"" or ""bold""

. Moreover, CP/M lacked cursor keys; for example WordStar used the E-S-D-X-centered ""diamond"" for cursor navigation. A notable exception was the software Lexitype for MS-DOS that took inspiration from the Lexitron dedicated word processor's user interface and which",0.7079006433486938,0.8565658330917358,yes,0.06563534446215225,0.3384615384615385,0.30769230769230765
What was a key feature of early word processing software?,Early word processing software required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations for navigation instead of intuitive key presses.,"According to the context, a key feature of early word processing software was the ability to ""share content by diskette and print it"".","Word processor
. The program disk was inserted in one drive, and the system booted up. The data diskette was then put in the second drive. The operating system and the word processing program were combined in one file. Another of the early word processing adopters was Vydec, which created in 1973 the first modern text processor, the ""Vydec Word Processing System"". It had built-in multiple functions like the ability to share content by diskette and print it

Word processor
. The final step in word processing came with the advent of the personal computer in the late 1970s and 1980s and with the subsequent creation of word processing software. Word processing software that would create much more complex and capable output was developed and prices began to fall, making them more accessible to the public. By the late 1970s, computerized word processors were still primarily used by employees composing documents for large and midsized businesses (e.g

When did graphical user interfaces and WYSIWYG start being used in word processors?,Graphical user interfaces and WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) features started being used in word processors in the late 1980s with software like MacWrite.,"According to the context, graphical user interfaces such as ""copy and paste"" started being used in word processors around the late 1980s, specifically with the Gypsy word processor at Xerox PARC. The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) approach to word processing also emerged during this time, pioneered by the Xerox Alto computer and Bravo word processing program.","Word processor
. In the late 1980s, innovations such as the advent of laser printers, a ""typographic"" approach to word processing (WYSIWYG - What You See Is What You Get), using bitmap displays with multiple fonts (pioneered by the Xerox Alto computer and Bravo word processing program), and graphical user interfaces such as “copy and paste” (another Xerox PARC innovation, with the Gypsy word processor). These were popularized by MacWrite on the Apple Macintosh in 1983, and Microsoft Word on the IBM PC in 1984

Word processor
. These were probably the first true WYSIWYG word processors to become known to many people. Of particular interest also is the standardization of TrueType fonts used in both Macintosh and Windows PCs. While the publishers of the operating systems provide TrueType typefaces, they are largely gathered from traditional typefaces converted by smaller font publishing houses to replicate standard fonts
